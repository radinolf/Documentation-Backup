# Navigation Panel

## Introduction

The **Navigation Panel** lists the elements that can be added to the report. Elements that are already in the report are also listed here, so that you can remove them easily from the report.

To open or close the Navigation Panel, click the arrow button shown in the figure below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (5)>)

### **Navigation Panel**

The command buttons available in the Navigation panel are listed below. Each button opens the associated folder.

When you select an object, it is entered on the report immediately. Dimensions are placed on the rows, in the last position. Metrics are placed close to those already on the report.

The ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (4)>) button displays the objects in the report and removes them easily: just select an element to delete it.

Composite metrics are a combination of any type of expressions and metrics. The formula of a composite metric may contain an arbitrary number of metrics, numeric values, constants, mathematical operators, and/or logical operators.

### Filters of the Application <a href="#toc34301121" id="toc34301121"></a>

A filter specifies the conditions that must be met so that the data may be included in the report.

Various types of filters are usable inside a report. The simple and complex filters define a wide range of conditions with respect to which the data must be included or excluded.

In DAC, the filters are classified into the following groups:

* **Direct filters**, used to limit the data on the analysis lines (dimensions);
* **Range filters**, used to condition the values of the metrics.
