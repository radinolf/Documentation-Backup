# Report Catalog

You can open the report catalog of the application directly from the applications section on the Home Page.

Once you open up the application, clicking the report button at the top right opens the application’s report catalog.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (11)>)

The report catalog contains all of the application’s reports, organized into folders and subfolders, in order to provide the user with a familiar interface.

The main folders are listed on the left:

* _**Root**_

This lists the folders containing the reports that are published and displayed to the user.

Clicking on the folder, you will get a new visualization by list and not by icon. By selecting the items of the path you can browse _backwards_, to go back to the previous folders.

* _**My Reports**_

You can choose whether to save the reports created or edited by a user in a specific folder.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/1)

For each report, the user who created it and the user who made the last change are specified, with the respective dates.

The reports in the catalog show an icon representing the display type, in addition to the name:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (12)>)

**Search the reports** by entering the report name in the field at the top (see figure at the bottom). The search starts automatically after entering the first character.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (2)>)

Each report that meets the search criterion has a link to the folder. To access the report, select it from this list.
