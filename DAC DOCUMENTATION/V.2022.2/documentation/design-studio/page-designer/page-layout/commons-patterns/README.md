# Commons Patterns

This chapter will show common patterns and examples that are used to design responsive and flexible pages with page designer.

## [Base Pattern](base-pattern.md)

The “**base patterns**” that are easier to understand and to configure and they are later used to compose more complex patterns.

* [**Strech middle**](./#stretch-middle) it is a pattern with a central flexible widget and a side widget with fixed width.
* [**Stretch and Item fixed:**](./#stretch-and-item-fixed) it’s a combination of a flexible widgets and one or more widgets that are just after the flexible one.
* [Fixed widget on a side: ](./#fixed-widget-on-a-side)In this pattern there are one or more widget with fixed width that must be always rendered on the side of the page (right or left) and the remaining widget is flexible.
* [**Footer Fixed**](./#footer-fixed) it’s a pattern used to have a fixed footer at the bottom of the page.
* [**Grid**](./#grid) **:** it’s used to defined the layout of many widgets in the page, one more than one rows.
* [**Sidebar** ](./#sidebar)**:** it’s used to define a fixed sidebar on the left (usually).
* [**3 Columns with wrap:**](./#columns-with-wrap) it’s a pattern used to create a 3 column layout with flexible width and with wrapping enabled.

## [Pattern Composite](pattern-composite.md)

The “**composite patterns**” are frequently used to design complex pages (i.e. boards with many widget and responsive rules, complex input form etc) and requires a good understanding of the “base” pattern, since they are basically a “composition” of base patterns used together.

* [**Form**](./#form) this pattern is a composition of the “**Grid**” and “**Footer fixed**” pattern.
* [**Line Board**](./#line-board) the **Line Board** pattern is used to create complex pages like bord to monitor production lines, that requires to have many information and could be also consumed on smaller devices like tablets.
