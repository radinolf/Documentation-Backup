# Initiative

### Membership  an Initiative

An administrator of a space can invite you to join. Notification of an invitation arrives in the Incoming mail. The invitation message indicates  both the author of the invitation and the space involved.

You can access the space directly from the link in the invitation message. This link  will open a window where you can accept or reject the invitation by using the **join now** command. If the space is of the participatory type, the space contents will also be visible, below the **join** message.

You can also accept the invitation directly from the message in the notification, by selecting the item **Accept invitation.**

### &#xD;Quit a Group or Initiative

After joining a specific space (Group or Initiative), the user can quit the space by choosing **Quit this space** which is ONLY available in the action bar menu in the space itself.
