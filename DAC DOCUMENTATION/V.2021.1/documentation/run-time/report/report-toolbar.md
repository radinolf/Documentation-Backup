* The type of presentation of the report (image, table, or both)
* The exporting of the report to PDF, Excel, or CSV.
* **Printing** a report (**Print**), that is printed in PDF format (therefore, the same operations can be performed as when exporting the PDF and then printing).

_**Compatibility issue**: if you are using version 9.4.2 or 9.4.3 of_ Adobe Acrobat Reade&#x72;_, immediate printing is not permitted. Instead, you will be prompted to_ _save the report as a file. Only after saving will you be able to open and print it._

* Updating the data (**Reload data**) or restoring the report to the published form (**Reload report**), based on the DAC caching

* The row and column lock
* The editing layout of the crosstab; (cells grouped together, text at top, shows name levels, fit to page)
* The type of regrouping for the drill operations;
* The assignment of the hierarchical drill;
* The commands below open the pop-ups, showing the report items (levels, metrics, and filters).

The toolbar of the report can be hidden using the up button and reopened with the down button.

In the hidden form, the commands for printing and exporting (to PDF, Excel and CSV) remain available.

The publication of the reports may be configured by the administrator directly with the hidden toolbar, which will be enabled from the toolbar open down button .

Some configurations also include publication without the toolbar; in these instances, the Open button will be absent.
