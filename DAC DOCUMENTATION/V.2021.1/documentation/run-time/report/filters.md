# Filters

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

‌The filters are used to select the data for the calculation of the metrics and to limit the data to be included in the report.‌

DAC uses the filters created by the administrator and associates them with a new report or existing reports.‌

You can also create new filters by expressing the conditions on the dimensional levels and/or metrics in a report. These will be used exclusively by the report and cannot be made public.‌

Two types of filters can be defined:‌

* View Filter applied after the execution of the report, where it is possible to define a condition on the dimensional levels and the metrics in the report.
* Custom Filter, which is a direct filter that sets a condition on any dimensional level, including those not in the report. When this filter is defined, a new query will be made to the data warehouse.

‌

### View Filter <a href="#view-filter" id="view-filter"></a>

‌View Filter applies the filter condition after the execution of the report. Therefore it is only applicable to the metrics and levels in the report.

## ​‌Custom Filter

‌Custom Filter is a direct filter, that sets a condition on any dimensional level, including those not in the report. When this filter is defined.‌

A Custom Filter allows you to define a condition on the dimensional levels, as well as any dimensional levels not in the report.&#x20;
