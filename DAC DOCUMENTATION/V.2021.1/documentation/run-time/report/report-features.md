## Pop-up Menu

A pop-up menu is available in the report, which can be activated from dimensions and metrics, in row and column, and from the cells containing the data. The items listed depend on the where the drop-down menu is activated:

* **Main, Visualization, Object Explorer:** Some items from the Toolbar pop-up for the reports are displayed. In addition, depending on whether the menu was called from the dimensions on the rows or columns, the respective items for the wrap function, span function and the lock of the rows and columns are present.
* **Filters:** Shows the pop-up filters in the rows and columns.
* **Enable Cells Selection:** Select the cells to be formatted. After selection, the **Disables Selected cells** item is activated, to deselect them.

## Paging

You can establish the number of rows and columns the report is to be arranged into. This lets determine the number of pages needed to display the extracted data.

Simply choose the number of rows and columns from the menu available for the **Rows** and **Cols**; for each one of these, the actual number of rows and columns in the report is indicated in brackets. Use the drop-down lists to select a different number of rows and/or columns.
