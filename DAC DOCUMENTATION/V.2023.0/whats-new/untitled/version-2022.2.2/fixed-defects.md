# Fixed Defects

**This section of the Change Log provides a list of the defects solved.**

<table><thead><tr><th width="160">Activity ID</th><th>Description</th><th>Solution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>D4C-7659</td><td>Wrong dependency calculation when report associated to a widget.</td><td>Now if the report is used as a data source in a widget, it is reported in the dependency calculation</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7858</td><td>When you try to load a file with “File Selector”, it doesn’t load anything.</td><td>Solved the problem</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7418</td><td>The widget is published twice if I upgrade version using the 'Install' function from Widget hub.</td><td>Solved the problem</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7705</td><td>When opening column definition property, sometimes, it is very slow.</td><td>The opening time of the property has been reduced</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7738</td><td><p>In the source environment, the list of groups has been reorganized using folders.</p><p>After synchronizing groups in the target environment, user associations and page association with group were lost.</p></td><td>The reported problem has been resolved.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-4908</td><td>DAC Design Studio allows to create a page with 100 chars but on renaming only 25 chars are allowed. Renaming from the web allow up to 100 chars.</td><td>The rename of pages in Design Studio allows 100 chars.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-6602</td><td>When the page is renamed from the web application, the new name is applied on the page catalog but the metadata table base_object_infos is not updated with the new element name.</td><td>Now the metadata table <code>base_object_infos</code> is updated when the page is renamed.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7127</td><td>In a crosstab without levels on the rows, the data are displayed “shifted” by one column:<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (401).png" alt=""></td><td>Now when there aren't levels in the rows, the report body is not shifted in the crosstab widget.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7552</td><td><p>The report doesn’t display the proper value in the metric column if the report has a level configured to be sorted on a custom colum.</p><p>In the reported  case , the report is display the value of the custom column rather than the value from the metric, even if the applied header of the column is the one of the metric.</p><p> </p></td><td>Solved the problem</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7595</td><td>Has been found a bug that crosstabs are not correctly rendered if metrics and levels are put in columns. This bug has been affecting the XLS export of the data from the Smart Grid: the end users display all the columns in the smart grid, but when they export in XLS only the columns visible in the crosstab are exported in the file.</td><td>The issue is the old report's column definition has been defined once, then, having levels at columns this property does not work well (as it was not expected to work with this kind of report) and hides some columns in the crosstab. Made the visibility check to work correctly even in case the column definition is defined and the report has levels at columns.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7657</td><td>Impossible to remove page used in DT from report editor. <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (410).png" alt=""></td><td>Now it is possible to remove associated page from an existing drill through.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7674</td><td>Has been found a bug that the Page order in the landing page is modified after a synchronization. When a page is modified in the source environment and then synchronized in the target environment without synchronizing also the page catalog, the sorting of the folders in the target environment is modified and the folder in which the modified page is associated is moved in the last position.</td><td>When a new page is synchronized, the operation imports the page under the same folder and in the same order as the source page, creating folders of the path that do not exist. Instead, when a modified page is synchronized, the page is left in the same position if its originally path has not changed, or it is imported under the same folder and in the same order of the source page</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7677<br></td><td>When you open a report in the report editor, if you close it without executing it using the X in the upper right corner, the lock on the object is not removed. </td><td>Now whenever the report is closed, the lock is removed</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7683</td><td>Has been found that when you open a page, it sometimes happens that widgets do not display correctly. It happens with different types of widgets and on different pages,</td><td>The root cause of the incorrect display of widgets has been identified and resolved</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7826<br></td><td>When a level has a custom column for sorting and this report is positioned on the column the sorting does not consider the custom column. If the level is on the row all works fine.</td><td>Now when a level has a custom column for sorting and it is positioned on the column the sorting consider the custom column.</td></tr><tr><td>D4C-7846</td><td><p>After migration from 2022.1.4 to 2022.2.1 some custom widgets stopped working. Widgets generate a reference error on used external libraries. </p><p></p><p><strong>Reference Error</strong></p><p><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (483).png" alt="" data-size="original"></p></td><td><p>The problem was due to the reintroduction of AMD. Some third-party modules, such as Quill; OpenLayer and Katex, use anonymous define via AMD, so to load them you have to manage them manually.</p><p></p><p>For Shared Library:</p><ol><li>Create a js resource, for example register_module.js</li><li>In the new file load the resource and map it in a global variable <code>let resourcePath = invokeAngularService('dcyService').getLibraryPath('libraryLogicalName') + "/ol.js"; requirejs([resourcePath], (ol) => { window.ol = ol; });</code></li><li>Add the register_module.js to the librarry deps</li></ol><p>Inside a custom widget:</p><ol><li>Inside the controller <code>let quillPath = this.dcyService.getResourcePath('logicalName') + "/lib/quill/quill.js"; let katexPath = this.dcyService.getResourcePath('logicalName') + "/lib/katex/katex.js";requirejs([quillPath, katexPath], (Quill, katex) => { // Code here });</code></li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table>
