# Deprecations

s section of the Change Log, updated to the DAC **2022.0.0** version, provides a list of the deprecated functions, i.e. functions which are started to be abandoned in the DAC Platform. The FUNCTION GUARANTEED UNTIL VERSION column of the table in the following paragraph shows the release until which the function will be guaranteed; this means that, if a function is guaranteed until version 5.4, the function is guaranteed on the version prior to 5.4 and all its patches 5.4.x but it is potentially removable by Decisyon starting from version 5.5.0.
