# Permissions on Web Functions

At a single report level, DAC allows users to enable or deny access to some functions, such as data refresh or cell formatting, metric changes, etc. These limitations are added to those granted by the single license.

You can access function or event permissions through the **event-permission** property, in the _**Main**_ group. The events in this window are grouped by type of web license. Each event may be granted or not, by selecting the corresponding check in the _Grant_ and _Deny_ boxes.
