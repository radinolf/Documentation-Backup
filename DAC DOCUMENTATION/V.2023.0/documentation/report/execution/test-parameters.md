# Test Parameters



A report may contain parameters, inserted for example inside a metric or on a filter condition.

When you run the report in the DAC the system expects them to receive a value, for example, from parameters in the Page that publishes the report.

In the report development phase, you need to set the values of those parameters, in test mode: this will open a window of the type shown in the figure below, to provide these parameters with values.

These parameters may be defined before by opening the same pop-up with the property:

* _**testParams**_ (_Main_ group) to define any parameters in the report

The parameters, as mentioned above, may relate to:

* **Dimensional levels** in this case, you can either manually enter the value, or by selecting it from the pop-up menu. The menu is activated by clicking on the _**Value**_**,** which will display the list of all values associated with the level selected as a parameter.

* **Metrics**: in this case you can enter the value manually only (see following figure)

When the parameters are entered in [the prompts](/broken/pages/-MjE95PeRg5AqHCpE5Xs#_Prompt_dei_parametri) of your report, the **Init** and **Default** buttons are enabled. These allow you to save, respectively, the values entered as default or initialize the values to those defined as default. For details see [Report parameter prompts section](/broken/pages/-MjE95PeRg5AqHCpE5Xs#_Prompt_dei_parametri)
