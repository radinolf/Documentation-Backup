# Introduction

Widgets are small interactive graphical components used in Pages to display information and data in a visually appealing and intuitive way. A widget can be a chart, a table, a counter, a map, or any other element that can effectively represent and display data.

Using widgets in pages allows for dynamic and interactive data visualization, providing users with an immediate overview of information. Additionally, widgets can be customized to meet specific user and business needs. To use widgets in pages, one must first choose the type of widget to use based on the data they wish to display.

Once the widget is chosen, it can be positioned on the page and connected to the underlying data. This allows for automatic updates to the widget whenever the data changes, without having to manually refresh the page.&#x20;

In summary, widgets are interactive graphical components used in pages to display data in a visually appealing and intuitive way.

The widgets in Widget Designer are divided into three categories:

* [**Custom Widget**](widget-editor.md)**:** with complex workflows that meet your requirements. Once created and published, your custom widgets will be available in the palette for designing pages using Page Designer
  * any desired user interface to make widget setup more user-friendly using client technologies such as HTML, JavaScript and AngularJS
  * shared libraries that can be reused on multiple widgets
* In alternative it's possible to [**import your widget**](widget-editor.md#import-widget) and with the Widget Designer you can customize them.
* [**Widget HUB:** ](widget-hub.md)The DAC Widget Hub provides a wide range of widgets that you can use on your pages in addition to the existing widgets of the Page designer.
