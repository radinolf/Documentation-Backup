# Resource Catalog

Resources that refer to files, images and CSS, that can be used by other DAC modules, can be “loaded” into the application. In addition to individual files, the system can load entire folders and subfolders.

With the **Resource catalogue** module (_**Application**_ menu item), a real catalog of the resources is created, which may be used as:

* Images loaded into a Page
* Images loaded on TAG @IMG for levels and metrics
* JavaScript or CSS associated with Page pages
* Logos for PDF exports

Use the **New** button to open a window with access to the local folders. This is where you can select the file and generate a resource.

Once the resource is selected, a window opens, where confirmation to perform the loading is requested. Once the operation is confirmed, a progress bar is displayed.

Once loading has finished, the resource is added to the document repository:

* For the resource to be generated, you have to configure this repository beforehand.

You cannot rename loaded resources since the name of the resource must coincide with the name of the loaded file.

Mass deletion of several resources is allowed by selecting them and choosing delete (right button of the mouse). Once the resource is selected, a window opens, where confirmation to perform the deletion is requested. Once the operation is confirmed, a progress bar will be displayed.

In case a mass resource deletion is interrupted, the system deletes up to the current resource and interrupts the flow. Likewise, to interrupt a mass import, the system loads up to the current resource and interrupts the flow.

Once the file is uploaded, you can enter the resource information in detail:

* The _Browse_ button (_Update_ pane) opens the loading page of the resources to make the updates.
* In the _Resource details_ pane, all the information on the resource is detailed: the file name, its creation date, the user who created it, the date of the last change, the type and measurements of the file.
* The _Preview_ pane shows a preview of the file if possible
* The _Download_ button (_Download file_ pane), saves the resource in the local folder.
