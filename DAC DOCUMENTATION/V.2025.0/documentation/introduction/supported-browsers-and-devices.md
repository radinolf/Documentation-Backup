# Supported Browsers and Devices

## Compatible browsers

**Decisyon App Composer** platform is based on web technologies that might not be compatible with all old browsers. Therefore, DAC provides certified support for specific browsers and versions.

Browser officially supported is:

<table><thead><tr><th width="215">Browser</th><th width="142">Version</th><th>Website</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Microsoft Edge</td><td>Latest Version</td><td><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ</a></td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2052).png" alt="" data-size="line">Google Chrome</td><td>Latest Version</td><td><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/">https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

It does not mention specific browser version numbers due to the frequency of browser version updates.

We recommend business users use this desktop browser and upgrade it to the latest version available from their official websites.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a business user uses an outdated and unsupported browser version, most of the web app's functionalities will likely still work. However, there's a possibility that certain features may not work as expected. Should you encounter any issues, please reach out to your Decisyon representative for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Every App Composer major release undergoes compatibility testing with the latest publicly available browser versions that are officially supported. While other web browsers might work with App Composer pages, they haven't been extensively tested. Therefore, **it is not recommended** to use unsupported browsers to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with the platform.

## Device and browser settings

App Composer requires JavaScript and cookie to be enabled in the browser.&#x20;

To enhance client performance, App Composer utilizes browser cache for both reading and writing operations.

App Composer uses viewport breakpoints to adjust the layout and design of components and pages based on the screen size. These breakpoints are defined as CSS media queries that are triggered when the screen size matches a specific range of values.

These are the breakpoints used:

<table><thead><tr><th width="237">Breakpoint</th><th>Common devices</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>width &#x3C; 480px</td><td>Phone in portrait - ⚠️Not supported by App Composer</td></tr><tr><td>480px &#x3C;= width &#x3C;960</td><td>Tablet in portrait</td></tr><tr><td>width >= 960</td><td>Tablet in landscape<br>Desktop</td></tr></tbody></table>

## App Composer Mobile App

App Composer does not offer a dedicated app for tablets; instead, it requires users to access the platform using the Chrome browser on their device. The user interface of App Composer has been optimized to be responsive, adjusting according to the device's resolution. This ensures a seamless experience without the need for compatibility with specific devices.
