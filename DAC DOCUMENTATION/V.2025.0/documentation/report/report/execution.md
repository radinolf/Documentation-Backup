# Execution

Clicking the Execute button starts the execution of the report, i.e. of the corresponding queries generated by the report.

During execution the system displays a window, where:

* in the _**Step View**_ folder the queries executed for the creation of the final report datamart are listed.
* in the _**Sql View**_ folder, the SQL code of the query being executed at that moment is displayed.
* the _**Statistics**_ folder, created at the end of the execution, shows a summary of information on the use of the automatic or absolute cache, on the date the report reference was created in the cache.

The first progress bar shows the report execution in real time, while the second bar shows the execution of any advanced metrics functions.

When execution is completed, the Close button is activated, which closes the window. If an error occurs, execution is stopped and the Edit button is activated, allowing the user to reopen the _Editing_ _report_ windo&#x77;_._

A specific property allows you to set the maximum execution time of the report:

* from the report property, in the Main _group_, we access the window of the **advanced** property
* _**maxExecTime**_ defines the minimum time (in minutes) for report execution, (the default is -1, indicating the absence of controls on loading time).
