# Migration Notes

### YAML Update – New Required Properties

The YAML file used for software installation has been updated to include **new configuration properties**.\
It is **strongly recommended** to carefully follow the updated [installation guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mf1nqOzbgLBl5PsDWsN/s/SZPuXAjYCF5nz4it3bew/) and ensure that all new properties are configured **correctly and consistently**.

Incomplete or incorrect configuration may affect the proper functioning of the system.

### Deprecated APIs and API Level Change

Some previously available APIs have been **deprecated**.\
We recommend migrating to the new APIs, which offer improved stability, support, and future compatibility. The full list of deprecated APIs and their respective alternatives is available in the [deprecation ](../../deprecations.md)document.

Additionally, the[ **API level has changed**](https://dac-documentation-1.gitbook.io/dac-api/), and existing integrations may require adjustments to align with the new structure and authentication mechanisms.
