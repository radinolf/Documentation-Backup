# Report Catalog

Reports are organized in a catalog where they are saved and from which it is possible to open them.

You can open a report from the catalog by clicking on File >> Open report or directly from the toolbar with the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/32 (9).png>) Button.

To save a report click on the File >> Save menu item or >> Save as or use the corresponding commands on the toolbar ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/34 (7).png>).

Both operations open the catalog on the folder last accessed by the user:

* to open a report just double-click to select it or click on the _**Ok**_ button;

* to save a report just type its name in the bottom panel, after choosing the folder where it should be stored.

During the installation of DAC, the system creates two folders in Root:

LOCAL used as working folder (reports in this folder cannot be published)

Users\* which includes all the users’ favorite folders, in the DAC catalog. The folder name is just the _Username_ of the user himself.

The top right button allows you to create new main folders; these can then be published on DAC, defining the associated [privileges](/broken/pages/-MfHyDAACqZ8KGz7lYEL#_Privilegi_sui_report).

_Buttons for the operations of cut, copy, paste and delete are especially useful to move reports from one folder to the other (because drag & drop is not enabled)._

The bottom panel contains the report search functions.
