# 🆕 Personas

In App Composer, there are distinct [personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_\(user_experience\)) and it is important to understand the objective of each one.

## Business User / End user

The **business user** is the **end-user** of the application, who interacts with the web application to perform various tasks but does not have the ability to modify the application itself.

Some business users may have assigned higher scope to execute minor administrator tasks, like creating users. \
\
Business users don't have access to Design Studio.

## Administrator / App Developer

The App Developer (also referred to as "**System Administrator**" or just "**Administrator**") is responsible for building, customizing, and maintaining the application.&#x20;

App Developers use both Design Studio and App Composer web to create and modify applications, map the data model, create pages and everything required to build the application based on customer requirements.

## Widget Developer

A **Widget Developer** is an App Developer who specializes in building widgets for App Composer using the Widget Designer. Widget Developers are responsible for creating and customizing widgets to meet specific business needs, using a variety of tools and techniques provided by the Widget Designer.

This role does not have any additional technical requirements beyond those of a standard App Developer, but a Widget Developer does not need to be proficient in building full applications.

Widget developers use **Widget Designer** in the web application, an although they have access to Design Studio it could not be required to create a new widget.

## devOps

**devOps** is responsible for deploying and managing the infrastructure required by App Composer, including installing and configuring services and monitoring application performance.

Usually devOps don't need to have access to Design Studio or App Composer, even if they are frequently configured as "App Developer".&#x20;



By having these distinct personas, App Composer enables organizations to separate the responsibilities of building and managing an application, allowing each persona to focus on their primary tasks.
