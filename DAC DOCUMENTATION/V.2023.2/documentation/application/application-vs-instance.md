# 🆕 Application vs Instance

In App Composer, both objects and properties can be created or defined at either the **application level** or the **instance level**.&#x20;

Application-specific objects and properties belong to a particular application, such as pages, groups, filters or the default data source used by that application.&#x20;

Instance objects and properties, on the other hand, apply to the entire instance of App Composer and are **shared across all applications**. Examples of instance-level settings include the default language and the SMTP server to use.&#x20;

Understanding the differences between application-specific and shared objects and between application-specific and instance-level properties is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications in App Composer.
