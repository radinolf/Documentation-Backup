# Swagger e Postman

Swagger serves as the reference documentation for the App Composer API. This resource is designed to provide developers with detailed information on how to effectively integrate and utilize the DAC APIs within their applications.&#x20;

The Swagger documentation includes specifications on available endpoints, supported operations, expected request and response structures, and examples of use cases.&#x20;

Additionally, the Swagger documentation offers interactive features that allow developers to directly test API calls within the documentation environment, promoting a deeper understanding and facilitating easier integration.

You can access on the documentation by the main menu of the webapp from **Online Help >> REST API Documentation.**

1. You can select the API version from the dropdown in the upper right corner
2. In "server" you can see the URL of your application.
3. The "Authorize" button lets you insert a Bearer token in Swagger, enabling you to run API requests straight from the documentation.
4. In the Swagger documentation, APIs are grouped by category for both versions.
5. This link  opens the Open API definition of App Composer API for the version selected. To many info please see the details

## Open API definition of App Composer API

The link under the Swagger documentation title allows you to open the API definition for the App Composer. As shown in the figure, the API definition is in JSON format.&#x20;

If you import this JSON file into Postman, all DAC APIs will be automatically added to the Postman API catalog.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Swagger: how to execute requests

To test DAC APIs, it's essential to be authorized through the [authorization token](authentication.md#generate-token), which is generated in the DAC user profile. The video below shows you how to proceed step by step.

## Postman

Postman is a third part of tool that you can use to execute the DAC APIs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember : to invoke a **DAC REST API**, a bearer token is required to authorize the request. The token to be use is generated from the [user profile](../../user-management/user-profile-and-change-password.md) page.

`Authorization: Bearer <DAC Token>`
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (81).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Insert the URL of DAC APIs
2. In the Headers insert  key and value :`Authorization: Bearer <DAC Token>`

The response of an API call is displayed in the response body section, located at the bottom of the Postman window. After sending a request, the response is shown below the request pane in the bottom part of the Postman user interface. You can expand this section to view all response details, including JSON data, errors, and other metadata returned by the API call.

### Import OpenAPI in Postman

This is how you can download and import in Postman the API definition

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stap 1" %}
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the first step, choose the Swagger version from the 'Select a Definition' dropdown menu. In this example  we select the Version 1. Select the link located above the documentation title . This will open a new window containing the list of DAC APIs in JSON format. Save the content in a **.JSON** format.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 2" %}
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Open Postman and import the file saved in the previous step. For more information about the integration of Postman with an open API please see the reference documentation[ >>Integrate Postman with OpenAPI](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 3" %}
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We choose where to import DAC APIs
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 4" %}
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the image we can see how swagger create a new group that contains all the API for the Version 1.&#x20;
