### **How to Deploy Application** <a href="#how-to-deploy-application" id="how-to-deploy-application"></a>

Deployment or online synchronization is recommended the web app of the target environment must always be active and accessible from  the Design Studio of the source environment.

To execute the deployment of the existing application Access on Design Studio and select the menu item

**Cloud >>Application Management >> Deploy**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (313).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**DAC URL:** enter the URL target DAC where the application will be deployed.

**Authorization Token :** enter a valid Token. The Authorization Token must be generated by the [User Admin](../user-management/user-profile-and-change-password.md#generate-token), from the target environment.

Select the type of Deployment. In this example we will Deploy the whole application.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (388).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The DAC calculates the type of operation to be performed on each individual object. In this case it will be an ADD operation because the application of the target environment does not exist.

In the next steps the DAC imports all objects into the target application.

The synchronization process has been completed.

### How to sync via File from Design Studio <a href="#how-to-sync-via-file-from-design-studio" id="how-to-sync-via-file-from-design-studio"></a>

In this example, an application will be sync from the source environment to the target environment.

**Step 1 - Access on Design Studio of Destination Environment**

It is necessary to create a metadata file in the App Composer avallabile in the Destination Environment.

The Metadata File to import a new application is a file where all the information is stored about the objects shared between all the workspaces available.

Access on the Destination Environment and in order to execute this action go to **Application >> Share** and select **Share Metadata File:**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1530).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Select the option “Generate the Metadata file for importing a new application”. At the end of the procedure the system will generate the Metadata File. The file must be saved (metadata\_app\_file.ctr).

**Step 2- Send the Metadata File to the Source Environment**

At this point you send the Metadata File to the **Source Environment** and you can start the deployment.

* Go to **Application** >>**Share** and select **Export**
* From the wizard, select the Metadata file (metadata\_app\_file.ctr). The system will perform a control procedure on both the objects and the metadata versioning because they need to be the same on both applications.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (320).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now you are ready to perform the export of all objects or of the selected ones.

In the last step the system will require you to save the Export File.

The Export File contains the operations to be executed when the application is exported in the destination.

**Step 3 - Import the .adp file into the Destination Environment**

Get the Export File and send it to the **Destination Environment** and execute the import using a File.

From the toolbar select **Application>> Share** and select **Import.**

Once the importing process has finished the new application will be available in the application catalog list **File>> Application Management**.

### How to synchronize two applications using the Web module. <a href="#how-to-synchronize-two-applications-using-the-web-module." id="how-to-synchronize-two-applications-using-the-web-module."></a>

**Step 1 Connect on Destination Environment**\
We connect to the RunTime of destination environment.\
Select by the Main Menu the item **Administration** >> **Application Synchronization.**\
On the top left menu select the item Share Metadata File. In this way we are going to share into the file all the metadata information.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1523).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example we will generate a Metadata File for a new application. Select New Application ad select Export button. The system generate a control file.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (916).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 2 - Open Design Studio of Source Environment**

Open the Design Studio of Source Environment and select the application that we want synchronize.

From the toolbar Design Studio of Source Environment select **Application**>> **Share**>>**Export.**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1127).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We select the Control File of destination application.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1526).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select whether you want export all of the application objects or manually select the specific items you want to export.<br>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (317).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example we synchronize a page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (327).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the step 5 of the wizard save che Export file. The system generate the file of export that contains the information of the page that we want sync in destination.

**Step 3- Connect on Run Time of Destination Environment**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (321).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Open the Run Time of destination application and import the file exported by the source environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are synchronizing using a . adp file from a different environment than the one that created the Control (.ctr) file. you can disable id checking by selecting the **Ignore envronment id check.**<br>
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (336).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now the Page of the destination application is synchronized with the Page of the source application.

The page “Application Synchronization” shows all the previous synchronization that have been executed with information such as the status, the eventual error messages, the user that executed the operation etc.
