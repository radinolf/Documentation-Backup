# Tasks and Taskboard

DAC offers an activity management solution, which lets you assign tasks to users.

Task processing involves the following statuses:

* NEW, the user (author) creates and assigns a task to another user (assignee)
* IN PROGRESS , the task is accepted by the assignee
* CLOSED, the task is resolved by the assignee
* PAUSED: the task is put on hold.

When a task is assigned, the recipient receives a message in his Incoming mail and a notification e-mail, which allows the recipient to access it directly. The author and assignee can exchange comments and attach files. The users concerned with controlling the evolution of a task may be entered in the list of recipients of the notification e-mail. This way they can access the task exclusively from the link in the e-mail received.&#x20;

The only beneficiaries of this enabling are DAC users; unregistered users instead may receive Task progress e-mails but may not access the system. The association with the user takes place through the e-mail address.
{% endhint %}

### How to create new Task

In the window for creating a new task, the user can enter the task **title** in the first field. This field cannot be edited by the assignee. The task **description** can also be entered, and the assignee has the ability to edit this field.

**Attachments** can be added to the task, including one or more documents, and a priority level can be assigned. Additionally, a deadline for the task can be defined, which the system uses to notify all relevant users via email when the task expires.

The user can then select the user to be **courtesy copied**, assign a category, and add tags to the task. Upon creation, the task is initially in the "New" state.

The task **assignee** receives an email notification regarding the new task and can access it directly from the email, notification, or the Task Board. When the user begins working on the task, they can move it to the "In Progress" state.

Within the **Solution** section, it is possible to input a solution for the assigned task.

If the user needs to temporarily halt task processing, they can transition it to the "Paused" state. Once the task is completed, it can be moved to the "Closed" state.

The task's creator will see on their task board that the task is marked as closed.

### How to delete Task

To delete task select the delete item by the contextual menu
