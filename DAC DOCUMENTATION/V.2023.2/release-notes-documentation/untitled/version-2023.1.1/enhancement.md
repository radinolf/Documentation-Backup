# Enhancement

**D4C-7205 Automatic update of default authentication service in Design Studio**

When the container starts/reboot AND there is a **default** authentication service configured in Design Studio, App Composer will automatically upgrade the parameters of the default authentication service leveraging the ENV variables of the container\
So that I don't the connectivity via OIDC from Design Studio will work even when the devOps modified the parameters of the webapp.



**D4C-8570  Expose in Swagger API to manage the "Terms of Use"**

Now it's possible to use the  REST API documented in Swagger to manage and configure the “Terms of Use” without logging in the UI of App Composer.



**D4C-8615 Expose in Swagger API to manage the "Logo\&Colors"**
