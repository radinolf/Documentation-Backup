# Task

DAC offers an activity management solution, which lets you assign tasks to users.

Task processing involves the following statuses:

* NEW, the user (author) creates and assigns a task to another user (assignee)
* ACCEPTED, the task is accepted by the assignee
* CLOSED, the task is resolved by the assignee

When a task is assigned, the recipient receives a message in his Incoming mail and a notification e-mail, which allows the recipient to access it directly. The author and assignee can exchange comments and attach files. The users concerned with controlling the evolution of a task may be entered in the list of recipients of the notification e-mail. This way they can access the task exclusively from the link in the e-mail received.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The only beneficiaries of this enabling are DAC users; unregistered users instead may receive Task progress e-mails but may not access the system. The association with the user takes place through the e-mail address.
