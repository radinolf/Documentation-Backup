# SQL code generated and Datamart

### SQL Code Generated

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (5).png>)The SQL code generated by DAC and executed in DataWarehouse is displayed in the _**Query Viewer**_ window, opened using one of the buttons of the _Editing Report_ window.

The SQL code is the same shown in the SQL View folder, during the execution.

The difference between the two buttons is that the first gives a colored formatting to the instructions, and the second one does not.

The generated code exists in the creation of temporary tables to hold advanced and composite metrics, until the final datamart containing all report data is created.

A specific property allows you to define a logical condition to be applied as a ‘HAVING’ clause to the query of final selection of the repository:

* from the report property, in the _Main_ group, we access the window of the **advanced** property
* _**having-clause**_ (_SQL_ _-custom_ group) opens a pop-up in which you type the ‘havin&#x67;_**’**_ conditio&#x6E;_._

### Report Datamart

The report datamart is a temporary table where the information in the report is stored: all displays of the report take their data from this table.

The table is created on report execution and, if default enabling is left on, it is saved in cache.

This table is structured as follows:

* For each level found in the report two columns are created: one for the key and the other for the description
* For each first level metric and advanced metric a corresponding column is created
* For each composite metric, columns to contain the component metrics are created.
