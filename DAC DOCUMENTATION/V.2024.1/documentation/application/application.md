# Create Application

DAC applications are created from the **Manage Application** window, opened from the menu item:

**File >> Manage Application**

A wizard, will show you all the existing applications on the left. The wizard will also allow you to create a new app from scratch. As shown in the figure below, you create an application by defining the descriptive parameters and the data warehouse association parameters.

A DAC application is a set of different objects and functions that you bring together to create the functionality you need. For example, an application contains pages and a rules schedule which are configurable.

The Welcome Screen is the first and central part of DAC-DS where the developer has instantaneous access to the main and most frequent functions used to create an application.

The **Recently used** table shows the latest edited objects, in chronological order. Select one of these to directly open its edit window. The detailed information below is available for each object.

* **Name:** component name.
* **Type:** Component type (e.g. Report, Metric, Page…).
* **Last Edit:** date and time of the last edit.

The DAC-DS toolbar is shown in the following figure:

Once the application is loaded, a first line toolbar is enabled. Once a report is opened, two more toolbar lines are enabled, which show the functions that can be applied to the report.

As the mouse moves over a button, the tooltip is enabled, providing a short description of the associated function as described below:
