# 🆕 Logs

### Introduction

Logs are a fundamental tool for troubleshooting issues and bugs of both the application you are building or App Composer itself.

When you contact the Decisyon customer support, most probably you will be asked to provide logs.

App Composer allows to download logs of both Design Studio and Runtime.

### &#x20;Log in Runtime

The DAC generates logs that are addressed to the standard output or stored in a file to be later downloaded.&#x20;

Therefore, it is feasible to implement and use an external logs aggregator services configured to work on the Kubernetes cluster to centralize the management of logs. This approach is invaluable for debugging purposes or for real-time monitoring, allowing developers or system administrators to view logs directly on the console or at a terminal while the application is running.&#x20;

Some examples of popular logs aggregators include solutions such as New Relic, Datadog and ELK.

It’s also possible to retrieve logs from the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) command line:

```
kubectl -n <cluster name> logs <pod name> -f
```

The log level applies only to the POD are connected to. So we have a deployment with more than one POD, the operation must be repeated for each POD.

{% tab title="Rancher " %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Azure" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



{% hint style="info" %}
Logs that write on the Standard Outup of POD's don't have the same level of details of the  Log contains in the file.zip
{% endhint %}

If you want to download the logs from the application or you don't have a direct access to the log aggregator service, in the _General Information_ section, the **Log Export** button is available, which allows the user to export in a zip file the logs generated by App Composer.

It’s also possible to configure the _level_ of information to be saved in the log file.

The available levels are the following:

<table><thead><tr><th width="149">Log Level</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OFF</strong></td><td>Disable system logging</td></tr><tr><td><strong>FATAL</strong></td><td>Only errors considered fatal by DAC are stored</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ERROR</strong></td><td>Any error which occurs during execution of the application are is stored</td></tr><tr><td><strong>INFO</strong></td><td>Logs informative messages, that can be useful for monitoring, tracking, and diagnosing activities of the application. These messages typically provide general information or details related to activities or events within an application, but they are not critical or of high severity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DEBUG</strong></td><td><p>Any information considered useful to debug the application is stored.</p><p>This is the <strong>default</strong> log level.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TRACE</strong></td><td>Any information about the connection request.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ALL</strong></td><td>Monitors and saves any information</td></tr></tbody></table>



{% hint style="info" %}
Il Log Level (FATAL, ERROR, INFO ecc..) is applied  both the file. zip downloaded by the Ds or Runtime both the log available in the standard ouput.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The configured level remains valid also after the logout from DAC or a restart of the Pod.

When the log is downloaded from Runtime, several .log files are zipped in the same zip file

In the figure below we show the contents of the Log downloaded from runtime.

Logs are organized by category. Below you can find a description of each available log file.

<table><thead><tr><th width="204">File Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Decisyon.log</strong></td><td>Information about any task executed in DAC. This is the main log file.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>i18N.log</strong></td><td>Information about <a href="multilanguage-and-localization/">language management</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Report.log</strong></td><td>Information about the <a href="../report/execution/">execution of reports</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ScheduledTask.log</strong></td><td>Information about scheduled internal DAC task.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security.log</strong></td><td>Information about the security (parameter evaluation, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Session.log</strong></td><td>Information about the http sessions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Snippet.log</strong></td><td>Information about the execution of <a href="../sdk-and-api/code-snipped-editor/">snippets</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Talend.log</strong></td><td>Information about executing <a href="../app-functionality/jobs.md">Talend jobs</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Log in Design Studio

From Design Studio, go to the Help menu and select Logs. It will open the folders in your operating system where the logs of Design Studio are saved.

### Log rotation

The log files are stored in a **.zip** file. Each file reaches a maximum size of of 20 megabytes and is automatically deleted a week after its creation.&#x20;

If several logs are produced in the same day, then the file name will have a date and an increasing progressive number.&#x20;

This is applicable for both the logs of Design Studio and Runtime.

### Log Format

In the image below we analyze a line of the log to understand which elements are traced.

Let’s see how to analyze in detail a line of DAC log.

{% code lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```
2023-10-31 10:20:12,792 INFO com.decis.sessi.manager [http-nio-8080-exec-602] [SessionManager] New Session Created C7B27CBBA42F4C03340187618B1C47C4code
```
{% endcode %}

* **Timestamp**: 2023-10-31 10:20:12,792
  * This indicates that the event was logged on October 31, 2023, at 10:20:12 with millisecond precision (792 milliseconds) in UTC time zone.
* **Log Level**: INFO
  * This indicates that the event has an "INFO" log level, which typically means it's an informational message and not critical.
* **Log Origin**: com.decis.sessi.manager
  * This is the log's origin and indicates that the event was generated by a class or component named "`com.decis.sessi.manager`."
* **Thread**: \[http-nio-8080-exec-602]
  * This part of the log indicates the name of the thread that generated the event, which in this case is "`[http-nio-8080-exec-602]`."
* **Message**: \[SessionManager] New Session Created C7B27CBBA42F4C03340187618B1C47C4
  * This is the main log message. It indicates that the "SessionManager" has successfully created a new session and provides a unique identifier for this new session, which is "C7B27CBBA42F4C03340187618B1C47C4."

In summary, this log line reports that the "SessionManager" has successfully created a new session with a unique identifier "C7B27CBBA42F4C03340187618B1C47C4" on October 31, 2023, at 10:20:12 with millisecond precision. The log level is "INFO," indicating it's an informational message.
