# Modifying a Document (Author and Co-authors)

The author and co-authors are authorized to modify the document. A user becomes a document co-author if:

* he has been chosen as a **Specific User** for the edit (_Editing and publishing_ folder)
* he has been chosen as the **Specific User** for the read (specific User in the _Visibility_ folder, the edit is enabled for everyone -- the option _Everyone_ is selected in the _Editing and publishing_ folder)

The figure below shows the display of a document for a user with edit privileges.

Open **previous versions** of the document

Click on _**version**_ **number** to open a pop-up window containing the version history (see figure below).

​

The button located near each version allows you to open the document in the version selected and to edit its content.

If you save a document from a previous version, it overwrites the previous one.
