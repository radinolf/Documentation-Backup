# Contextual collaboration

DAC offers functionalities for Collaboration related to the data.

It is possible to start [discussions ](discussion.md)on the individual cells of the report.

DAC users can use these functions only on the reports enabled by the administrator.

The following figure highlights the collaboration menu items enabled on the report .

You can also define a shared context between reports, so that multiple reports can share the Discussions :

For example, when a discussion on a certain level (such as product) is added, this will also be visible on the second report if the two reports share the same context.

The **Discussion** on the report is enabled by the property (Collaboration group)&#x20;

* **activateCellsDiscussion** enables the Attach Discussion item in the pop-up menu of DAC report cells. This property enables the following:
  * **shared-context** enables context sharing with other reports, so that discussions in it can be useful not only on the report itself, but also on other reports.
  * **context-id** is the shared context identifier

If, for example, two reports have the same context-id when a discussion is submitted on a certain level (such as product), this will also be visible on the second report.

**Note:** Users can comment on or change Discussions on all the reports that share the context, if they have the permissions on at least one of the reports.
