# API Key

The **API Key** are essentially unique tokens that allow applications to communicate with the server securely and in a controlled manner, without needing to request user credentials each time. This is particularly useful for operations not tied to a specific user, but rather to a system user.



{% hint style="success" %}
If it's necessary to create **API Key**, then **Cockpit must also be installed** in the production environment.
{% endhint %}

In the main interface, the generated API Keys are visible along with their detailed information, including:

* **Description**: A description for the created API.
* **API Key**: Displays a portion of the generated API Key.
* **Creation Date**: The date when the API Key was created.
* **Expiration Date**: The expiration date, if set.

The **trash** icon allows you to remove the API Key and all its associated references.
