# Enhancement

* **DACXX-856**: DAC now ensures that user attributes are automatically updated based on identity provider (IdP) claims during user login. This improvement allows to maintain consistency between the IdP and DAC for key user information such as first name, last name, and email address.
* **DACXX-688**: The organization selector is now visible not only on pages but also within folders. This improvement helps business users quickly identify the organization (formerly tenant) they are operating in, without needing to navigate back to a single page.
* **DACXX-826**: Extended regex rule to support specific email formats.
* **D4C-9619:** Added support to configure the STARTTLS property for SMTP servers to enhance email security. See [Manage Services & Servers](../../../documentation/instance-configuration/tools/manage-services-and-servers.md)
