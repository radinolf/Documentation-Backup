# What's New

With the release of the 2022.2.2 patch, two improvements were introduced. One related to the [HUB widget](whats-new.md#widget-hub) interface and the other required the deletion of a misleading [message ](whats-new.md#removed-the-message-when-the-connection-to-the-server-is-discontinued)for the end user. Please see the [Enhancement](enhancement.md) page.

Some bugs have also been fixed. Please see the [Fixed Defects](fixed-defects.md) page.

### Widget Hub

Some improvements have been made in the Widget HUB section. The request was to highlight the HUB Widget folder. In addition, a new button has been introduced to access the DAC widget HUB to download widgets.

### Removed the message when the connection to the server is discontinued&#x20;

Removed the message warning the user, that the connection to the server was discontinuous. If there are real connection problems then the user is automatically disconnected.&#x20;
