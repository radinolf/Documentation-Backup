# Enhancements

This release includes the following improvements:

* **DACXX-1423 - Auto-Focus on Search Field in Pages Service**\
  The search field in the Pages service now automatically receives focus when the search toolbar is opened, allowing users to start typing immediately without an additional click. This improvement streamlines the search experience and enhances usability. The change affects search filters on pages in the Pages section and organizations in the Users Administration section.
* **DACXX-1422 - Enable Full-Screen Mode for Browser in Pages Service**\
  The full-view mode in the Pages service now enables full-screen mode for the entire browser, rather than only hiding the Decisyon interface. Users can exit full-screen mode using the ESC key or the full-view menu option. This enhancement improves readability by maximizing the available display area.
