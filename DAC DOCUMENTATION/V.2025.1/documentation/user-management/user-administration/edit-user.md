# Edit User

## Introduction

In User Management, various operations can be performed to manage user accounts and edit settings:

* **Manage User Account:** Enable/Disable, disconnect, and delete Users.
* **Edit User Settings**: Scope, location settings, associated Organizations and Groups, and User Attributes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Manage User Account and Edit User Settings depend on the [Scope](users-scope-and-scope.md#users-scope) (permissions) assigned to the connected user.
{% endhint %}

## Edit User Settings

Editing user settings can be performed from the [**Support Panel**](edit-user.md#support-panel) after selecting a user in the User List.&#x20;

Depending on the [**scope**](users-scope-and-scope.md) (permissions) of the connected user, the following settings can be edited:

1. **Scope:** Change permissions for the selected user.
2. **Location Settings:** Edit timezone, language, and notification settings. Settings options can also be customized by each user in their account from the User Profile section of Pages.
3. **Associations:** Modify the organizations and user groups associated with the selected user.
4. **Attributes:** Edit the user attributes.
