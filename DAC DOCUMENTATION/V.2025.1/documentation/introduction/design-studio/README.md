# Design Studio

Welcome to the Design Studio, one of our tools for application creation. Thanks to an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that provides our programmers with immediate access to all the necessary functionalities to create their own applications.

The welcome screen of the Design Studio shows a list of recently modified objects, making it easy for developers to access their latest work in chronological order. The tool panel contains all the necessary tools to create and modify objects within the application, ensuring that our programmers have everything they need at their fingertips.

The menu bar provides easy access to various functionalities of the DAC-DS, ranging from creating new pages to configuring the application. This makes the application development process faster and more efficient.
