# Cockpit

## Intorduction

Cockpit is a new microservice responsible for managing and monitoring applications in production environments where App Composer and Design Studio are not available. It is used by whitelisted application developers and centralizes monitoring and management functions through a UI and a set of APIs. This microservice allows developers to synchronize applications (especially in a multitenant architecture), delete applications, monitor job executions, manage scheduled action list executions and manage the application

Once logged in using the URL generated by the developer the Cockpit _Home Page_ opens
