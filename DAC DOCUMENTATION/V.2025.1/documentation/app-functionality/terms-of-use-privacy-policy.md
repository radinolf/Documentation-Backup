# Terms of Use/Privacy Policy

## Introduction&#x20;

The "Terms of Use/Privacy Policy " feature enhances the application's user agreement process by introducing a dialog that prompts business users to accept the Terms of Use/Privacy Policy  before gaining access to the applications. This ensures that all users are aware of and acknowledge the legal obligations, rights, and responsibilities associated with using the applications.

The dialog is presented to users just after their login process and requires their explicit acceptance to proceed further.

By enabling this feature (it’s optional and by default is disabled), administrator users can enforce compliance with applications Terms of Use/Privacy Policy  that must be uploaded in a PDF file.

In case a new updated version of the file is uploaded by administrator, then business users must accept again the new updated Terms of Use/Privacy Policy. The terms of use can be displayed at any time by all users connected to the application by selecting the item **Terms of Use/Privacy Policy.**

Once the document is uploaded, it will be possible to display it. Now you have to enable the "**Enable"** flag so all users will be required to accept the terms of use during their next login to gain access to the applications.

#### How to Replace the File for Terms of Use/Privacy Policy?

If you need to replace the Terms of Use/Privacy Policy  document, just import the new document version.
