# Fix Defect

&#x20;

*   **DACXX-2896-  Error deploying edits on group**

    The error during group edit synchronization has been fixed. Updates, additions, and deletions are now correctly handled without issues.
*   **DACXX-2966- Line page reloaded 3 times**

    The multiloading issue was resolved by adjusting the page configuration, with no code changes required. A related tab panel defect—where loading indicators could get stuck during tab switching on long page loads—has also been fixed.
*   **DACXX-2968-Line page fails when order closes**

    After updating to version 2025.1.2 and reviewing the relevant page, the issue no longer occurs. The behavior is now aligned with expectations, and no further action is required.
