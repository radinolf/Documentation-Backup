# New Feature

With this patch, a new section called '**App Management**' has been introduced in Cockpit.

**This** section allows for the synchronization of applications across different environments. It is possible to import a new application based on an existing one from another environment or update existing applications through synchronization. Additionally, each application offers functionalities such as application removal and log consultation, providing a centralized and comprehensive management experience.
