# Labels Management

Decisyon’s multilanguage support enables the Web module to display all Page objects and Reports in the language set by the user – for example, names of metrics, reports and dimensions; generic elements such as folders, descriptions and titles; and all page elements.

Select the Labels Management item from the Administration group in the vertical toolbar. The list of languages supported by the application is displayed in the table. The TAG column shows all tags within the application.A specific column is reserved for each language, containing the label’s translation.

## How to import a set of labels

The Labels Manaenent section allows, through the import and export functions, to export the business labels present in the application to an excel file. In this way you will have the possibility to add new labels, modify existing ones or delete them.

When the file is imported the old labels present in the system will be overwritten with those present in the file.

Attention!This feature overwrites all current labels with those imported into the file.

To add new labels to existing ones, it is advisable to first export the existing labels so as to create a backup.

From the side menu (with the three dots) select the Export Labels item. Then select the EXPORT button.

The system will export all the labels present to an excel file.
