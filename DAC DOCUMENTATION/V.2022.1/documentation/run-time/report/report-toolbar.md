# Report Toolbar

### Report Toolbar <a href="#toc34301088" id="toc34301088"></a>

The toolbar functions are subdivided into four sections.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (4)>)

* The type of presentation of the report (image, table, or both)
* The exporting of the report to PDF, Excel, or CSV.
* **Printing** a report (**Print**), that is printed in PDF format (therefore, the same operations can be performed as when exporting the PDF and then printing).

_**Compatibility issue**: if you are using version 9.4.2 or 9.4.3 of_ Adobe Acrobat Reade&#x72;_, immediate printing is not permitted. Instead, you will be prompted to save the report as a file. Only after saving will you be able to open and print it._

* Updating the data (**Reload data**) or restoring the report to the published form (**Reload report**), based on the DAC caching rules.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (1)>)

* The row and column lock
* The editing layout of the crosstab; (cells grouped together, text at top, shows name levels, fit to page)
* The type of regrouping for the drill operations;
* The assignment of the hierarchical drill;
* The commands below open the pop-ups, showing the report items (levels, metrics, and filters).

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (1)>)

* Commands to customize the graphic shape of the report, shown below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/3 (1)>)

The toolbar of the report can be hidden using the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (1)>) button and reopened with the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (3)>) button.

In the hidden form, the commands for printing and exporting (to PDF, Excel and CSV) remain available.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (2)>)

The publication of the reports may be configured by the administrator directly with the hidden toolbar, which will be enabled from the toolbar open button ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (4)>).

Some configurations also include publication without the toolbar; in these instances, the Open button will be absent.

From the toolbar of the report (or pop-up menu) in the **Object** **explorer** section, there are commands to display the levels, metrics and filters of the report:
