# Export Report

### Introduction

You can export report in one of the following formats:

* as an Adobe PDF;
* as a Microsoft Excel file;
* as a CSV file.

These functions are available both as commands on the report toolbar, in the main section, and from the pop-up menu.

### MS Excel File

You can export in Excel format by clicking the Excel button on the Report toolbar’s **Visualization** section.

&#x20;DAC prompts you with a dialog window, where you specify the folder to save the file in. By default, DAC assigns the file the same name as the report. Type over that name if you want to change it.

If the report is saved successfully, DAC displays a confirmation message that indicates the path where the report was saved as a MS Excel file.

### CSV

You can export in CSV format by clicking the CSV button on the Report toolbar’s **Visualization** section.

DAC prompts you with a dialog window to confirm that you want to export the file. DAC uses the report name for the CSV file; you will not be able to change the file name during export.

If the file is opened with a complex editor such as Microsoft Excel, the data presentation in Excel could be different than in DAC. (For example, the formatting of decimal numbers might not appear as specified in DAC, and the columns might not be divided in Excel if the column separator and the text qualifier are set differently between DAC and Excel. To check the data is consistent between the DAC report and the CSV export, always check the file using a free text editor such as Notepad).

_Selecting the **Applies**_ _**page-by filters** item applies the page-by filters to the export of the report.If enabled, it only exports the values filtered by the pages of the report._
