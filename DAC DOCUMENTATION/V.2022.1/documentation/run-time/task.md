# Task

DAC offers an activity management solution, which lets you assign tasks to users.

Task processing involves the following statuses:

* NEW, the user (author) creates and assigns a task to another user (assignee)
* ACCEPTED, the task is accepted by the assignee
* CLOSED, the task is resolved by the assignee

When a task is assigned, the recipient receives a message in his Incoming mail and a notification e-mail, which allows the recipient to access it directly. The author and assignee can exchange comments and attach files. The users concerned with controlling the evolution of a task may be entered in the list of recipients of the notification e-mail. This way they can access the task exclusively from the link in the e-mail received.&#x20;

The only beneficiaries of this enabling are DAC users; unregistered users instead may receive Task progress e-mails but may not access the system. The association with the user takes place through the e-mail address.

In the window for creating a new task you can enter the task **title** in the first field. This field can’t be edited by the assignee.Enter the task **description**. The assignee can edit this field.

You can **attach** one or more documents to the task. You can also assign a priority.

You can define a **deadline** for the task. The system uses the deadline to warn all involved users that the task has expired. The notice is sent by email.\
If you want to publish the task on a specific **space**, select the social space. If you publish the task on a social space, the task assignee can only be selected from the list of members in that space. You can also select “Anyone in the space” from this list, and only users in the space can accept this task.\
Next, select the user **Courtesy copied**. Can also assign a **Category** and **Tags** to the task.\
When the task is created, is in the New state.

The task **assignee** receives an e-mail and a notification of the new task. Users access the task directly from the e-mail, notification or from the Task Board.\
When the user starts processing the activity, he moves it to the In Progress state.\
If the user wants to pause the processing of the task, it can go to the Paused state.\
When the task is closed, it can go to the Closed state.\
The creator of the task, on his task board, will see the task is closed.
