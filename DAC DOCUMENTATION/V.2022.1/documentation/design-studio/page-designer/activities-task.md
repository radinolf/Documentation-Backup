# Activities Task

DAC offers a solution to manage activities and to assign tasks to users.

You can manage tasks in DAC through reports or Page components enabled for this purpose. In fact, it is possible to assign tasks:

* on the report cells
* on some Page components (Graph, Indicator, Table)

Recipients can be notified of tasks through e-mails which give direct access to the task. Therefore, in order to access the task, the mail server and DAC server must be configured (see _System Administrator,_ _System properties on e-mail management_ section).

### Enabling Tasks on Page Components

The Page components used during the task assignment process are:

* Tables
* Crosstabs
* Graphs
* Indicators

You can activate components for the assignment of tasks by enabling the _**activate-Task**_ property in the **Title** group.

Example: Displaying Tasks on a component: GRAPH

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (118).png>)

_From Page Designer, we enter the graph-type component and in the TITLE section we enable the property activate-task. The graph in DAC will display the task button next to the title_![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/88 (3).png>)_. Clicking the button opens the window for inserting the new task._

### Shared Datamarts for Report Presentation Components

The system allows you to associate report presentation Page components (such as crosstabs, indicators, graphs, ...), so they use the same datamart, generated by a master component.

The other components dependent on it (slave) will NOT be executed. That is, the respective private datamart will NOT be created. The datamart for the master component will be generated before the other components, so that the dependent reports can access it. After the datamart has been changed, the reports associated with it will be upgraded to show any modified values.

This function minimizes the space required by the reports for each Page.

Components can use the datamart of a master object if the master object contains the levels of the dependent report. The following conditions must also be met:

* first-level and advanced metrics of the slave reports are to be contained in the master. The metrics required by the slave report can also be component metrics of a composite metric of the master report
* composite metrics that use the metric function (including the respective dependent metrics) of the slave reports are to be contained in the master. The metrics required by the slave report can also be component metrics of a composite metric of the master report
* the direct filters of the slave reports are to be contained in the master
* the range filters of the slave reports are to be contained in the master
* the custom filters of the slave reports must have a counterpart in the master, that is, a filter must exist in the master (direct, range or custom) such that its formula is equal to that of the custom filter of the dependent reports
* the master component cannot be defined as slave of another report

Compatibility between master and slave components is executed whenever the DAC user makes a change on the Page, using the report navigation. If they are not compatible, navigation is interrupted and an error message is shown. An error message is also received in cases where reports are changed by DAC.

Dependency is only valid in the Page where it is defined.

To define a report presentation component as slave, simply select the master report in the _**share-datamart**_ property:

* this property lists all reports that are used by the components of the Page (name and ID).

If an incompatible master report is selected, an error message will block the procedure, and indicate the reason

* the default item is \<repor&#x74;_-datamart>, which_ indicates the use of a private datamart, rather than a shared one

### Access to the Report Associated with the Component

You can access the report for the components which have an associated report. This behavior can be customized using the _**launch-report**_ property _**(ObjectStyle**_ group); if it is enabled, it lets you open, in the catalog, the report associated with the object (crosstab, graph, indicator, map) used for data display by double-clicking on the object or by clicking on the title of the object.

This property enables _**instance-type**_ which allows the user to decide, once the report associated with the object is launched, if the changes made to the report should have an impact on the starting object (_same instance_) or if the launched report is to be considered a separate instance (_clone instance_).

If you access the report associated with a crosstab (“launch report” property enabled), and perform operations on it (e.g. pivoting, operations on the page-bys, adding metrics or levels) and then use the “reload report” button, the report will return to the initial situation while maintaining the settings it had in the Page when the catalog was launched.

#### Passing Parameters among Several Pages

It is particularly useful to make Pages interact with each other, in order to transmit the analyses from one to another, reporting the choices of the filters on all the pages of interest.

There are different interaction modes among the Pages:

* shared parameters and page-bys
* Page open in DS

**Shared Parameters and Page-bys**

It is possible “to share” the parameters defined in a Page, to all the other Pages of the application, so that the choices made in Pages can affect all those which use the same parameter.

Also for page-bys you can activate sharing, so that the user has the same choices repeated on every Page. For example if a particular year is chosen in a Page, all the Pages will show the same year in the page-by levels.

The sharing of parameters and page-bys is applied at application property level (see _Parameters shared among several Pages_ section).

It is possible to "update" the page-bys with respect to the selections made in a "SELECT" or "CHECKLIST" object. By enabling the property of the **align-page-by-to-params Page** pag&#x65;**,** the following type of behavior is obtained:

* a "SELECT" or "CHECKLIST" object defined at a specific level and named with the same name as the corresponding dimensional level
* a "CROSSTAB" object, which has the same dimensional level defined in "SELECT", placed in page-by

&#x20;by selecting a level value in "SELECT", the same will be automatically displayed in the report of the same Page page.

Property of Page (align-page-by-to-params)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/89 (1).png>)

_One "Select" object and one "Crosstab" object are on the following Page. Note how by selecting any value in the "Select" object (in the above example "2004"), the same will be displayed in the report of the same Page page. The align-page-by-to-params property then allows aligning the parameters of a "Select" or "Checklist" object, to the page-bys (with the same name) of the reports on the same page._

**Passing Parameters Through Page Open in DS**

In the case of Drill-through towards another Page page, the parameters on the latter can be used both of the calling report and of the Page containing the report (it therefore becomes the calling Page).

Using the property:

* _**apply-DS-auto-filters**_ (_Filter_ group)

The automatic filters are applied originating from the drill-through in which the "apply-sel-a&#x73;_**-filter" option is enabled**_”.

#### Accessing Page from External Systems

Pages defined in DAC can be recalled: the system provides for the **automatic generation of a link**, including the desired parameters.

This makes it possible to dynamically link DAC Pages to external (web-type) applications, for example, by requesting the Page filtered by the parameters of the source application.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/90 (3).png>)

You can display the links:

* To open DAC directly on a specific Page page,
* To open the Page only, to then be entered in an application; this method is embedded.

The operations are the following:

* Enables any command of the Action Bar of the mashboard
* From the Page, open the settings menu from the button and select **Share** (only visible to administrators)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/91 (3).png>)

* From _Share_ a pop-up opens with two links, shown in the figure.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/92 (1).png>)

the following is the syntax of the two URLs:

**https://**_**\<PORT>/\<CONTEXT>/content/Page/\<OWNER>\_\<PAGE ID**>_**embedView?token=\<token>\&tenant\_id**

\
**https://**_**\<PORT>/\<CONTEXT>/content/Page/\<OWNER>\_\<PAGE ID**>_**view?token=\<token>\&tenant\_id**

where:

_**\<HOST> -**_ Host name or IP of the Application Server

_**\<PORT>**_ _**-**_ port of the Application Server

_**\<CONTEXT**_> _**-**_ name of the Web Application DAC

_**\<OWNER>**_ _**-**_ ID of the application

<_**Page**_ ID

* **view** _**-**_&#x66;or direct opening
* **embed view** _**-**_&#x66;or embed opening

**\<Token>** it's pobbible to insert the user token (Optional). In this case the page is accessed with the user to whom the token belongs.

**\<tenant\_id> :** This is the id of tenant selected in the page. When the tenant id is passed in query string, the page opens and the specified tenant is automatically selected,assuming the user is associated to the tenant. If the tenant id is not referring to any existing tenant of DAC, an error message is displayed to the user stating that the specified tenant doesn’t exists and user’s last tenant is automatically selected. If the user is not associated to the passed tenant, an error message is displayed to the user stating that the he/she is not authorized to the tenant and user’s last tenant is automatically selected.

For access to the Page already authenticated, enter the part shown below in the previous link:

_http://\<HOST>:\<PORT>/\<CONTEXT>/content/Page/\<OWNER>\_\<PAGE\_ID>/_\[view or embedView]_?**csUsrn=\<USER ID>\&csPass=\<PASSWORD>\[\&crypted=1]**_

where:

* **csUsrn:** user id
* **csPass:**&#x70;assword of the user clear or encrypted
* **crypted:** if the value 1 is set the password is encrypted. If you do not want to enter an encrypted password, the variable is not entered in the link.

The encrypted password for a specific user can be retrieved by the system administrator inside the SUBJECT table of the db. In this case the _CsPass_ variable will have the encrypted password associated

In the case where you want to enter the preselected parameters add the following syntax to the link:

_http://\<HOST>:\<PORT>/\<CONTEXT>/ content/Page/\<OWNER>\_\<PAGE ID>/_\[view or embedView]_?_ _**pNames=\<PARAMETER>\&pValues=\<VALUES>**_

where:

* _**\<PARAMETER>**_ is the list of the parameters

The parameters are listed separately from %23\_%23\_%23, so _n_ parameters have the following syntax:

_Param&#x31;**%23\_%23\_%23**Param&#x32;**%23\_%23\_%23**…Paramn_

* _**\<VALUE>**_ the corresponding values to be assigned to the parameters. The values of each parameter are always separated by the same separator _**%23\_%23\_%23**_.

So if _Param1_ has the value _Val1, Param2_ has the value _Val2, Paramn_ has the value _Valn_ the correct syntax is the following:

_Val&#x31;**%23\_%23\_%23**Val&#x32;**%23\_%23\_%23**…Valn_

In case one or more parameters must be assigned more values, the separator between the multivalue is _**%23%23%23%23%23**_

So if _Param1_ assumes three values _Val11, Val12 and Val13_ the syntax becomes:

_Val1&#x31;**%23%23%23%23%23**Val1&#x32;**%23%23%23%23%23**Val1&#x33;**%23\_%23\_%23**Val&#x32;**%23\_%23\_%23**…Valn_

&#x20;**Note:** _for operation on browsers IE8/IE10, often cleaning the cache is not sufficient to correctly use the direct access links, rather you must perform the following operations:_

1. _enable the “Always update from server” option, which is in “Development tools (F12)” -> Cache;_
2. _system “logout”;_
3. _access the system with one of the direct access links;_
4. _system “logout”;_
5. _disable the “Always update the server” option;_
6. _access with one of the direct access links._

Example of a Link to a Page

Step 1: Page link

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/93 (4).png>)

_Access a dashboard page in debug mode. Select the parameters, for example the following were selected:_

* _Area -> CENTER_
* _Region -> Lazio_
* _Business Unit -> Business Unit 01._

_Reload the page (click on the Sales Analysis tab). The parameters set are displayed in the debug window, page parameter value section._

Step 2: Page link

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/94 (1).png>)

_From the Action Bar select the button shown in the figure and choose the Share menu item._

_A window opens with two links_

* _Direct Link to the Page. Provides direct access to the Page page. Authentication is automatic and any page parameters are set automatically._
* _Direct link to DAC. To access DAC, placing it directly on the Page. The authentication mode is automatic._
* _The link with the passage of the parameters is as follows:_

_http://192.168.2.102:8080/Decisyon450MANUAL/content/Page/RTQDANB\_216381316292328/view?pNames=AREA\&pValues=2\&pNames=Region\&pValues=714\&pNames=Business\_Unit\&pValues=0_

_Note that in pName and pValue, the parameters exported from Page found in the debug window have been entered_

#### Predefined JavaScript Functions

DAC provides some Javascript functions accessible from the properties of the components which use this code, such as the JavaScript, Image or Execute button component.

The Javascript code entry window is a real Javascript text _Editor_ and the code commands are shown in a different color.

The code entered does not require the opening and closing _commands "<_&#x73;cript>\</script>" since the system enters them automatically during execution. If these were entered, they will be ignored.

JavaScript functions can also be used where it is possible to enter free text, such as in text objects of the Page or in the custom functions for the reports (_Presentation Administrator,_ _Custom functions for reports section_).

The **f(x)** button (top right) opens a window where you can select one of the _JavaScript functions_ shown by DAC that are directly applicable to Pages and Reports.

This window also shows other particularly useful functions.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/95 (1).png>)

**Page Management Functions**

In the _Page_ folder functions are gathered which may be applied to the Pages.

The reference to the Page is defined in _**object-id**_ property (_**metadataInfo**_, property _Advanced_ folder, _Advanced_ group).

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/96 (3).png>)

Below are the functions to be applied to the Pages:

* **extDshExportToExcel(**_**id**_**)** and **extDshExportToPdf(**_**id**_**)**

the functions export a specific Page in Excel and PDF format (_**id**_:_object-id_ id of the Page)

* **extSendParamChanged(**_**pName**_**,&#x20;**_**pValue**_**)**

Value a pName _**parameter**_ in the current Page, with the value specified in _**pValue**_

* **extSendCheckListParamChanged(**_**pName**_**,&#x20;**_**pValue**_**,&#x20;**_**type**_**,&#x20;**_**checked**_**)**

the value of a checklist is changed in the current Page, identified with _**pName parameter**_::

the value specified in _**pValue**_ is selected or not depending on whether _**0**_ or 1 is checked.

The _**type**_ indicates whether the value is numeric (_type: 0_) or a string (_type: 1_).

* **extReLaunchCurrentPage()**

Run the current Page (by possibly updating data and objects, regardless of the configuration of the update properties)

* **extRedirectToDsh(id) and extRedirectToDsh(id,params)**

It redirects the page to a specific Page (_**id**_:_object-id_ id of the Page). In the function the parameters may be indicated, to be used as filters for the specific Page.

* **extOpenDshDialog, extOpenDshModalDialog and extOpenDshModalDialogParam**

similar to the previous group, only that in this case a Page is opened.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/97 (3).png>)

* _**extExecuteButton**_**&#x20;(**_**custom-js-id**_ **)**

carries out the action associated with an _Execute button_ and includes, as a single parameter in input, the one defined in the _custom-js-id_ property of the Execute button.

* _**extRefreshObject (custom-js-id**_ _**)**_

The function runs the update of a specific component with a report, a graph or any form type report associated with it. The only parameter provided as input is the one defined in the _custom-js-id_ property of the component.

* _**extRefreshPagePage**_

The function allows for updates to be carried out for a specific component that has an associated report, or for those types of forms (i.e. under the file form in the Page Designer section).

**extRedirectToDsh with or without parameters**

It redirects the page to a specific Page (_**id**_:_object-id_ id of the Page). In the function the parameters may be indicated, to be used as filters for the specific Page.

The execution of the Page is preceded by an initial repost on a loading page, in which the repost to the desired Page page is subsequently carried out.

The function includes as parameters in input the ID of the Page page and possibly the list of the parameters to be sent, defined in the following format:

_\[{"name": "parameter\_name1", "value": ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_name2", "value ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_nameN", "Value ?parameterN?}]._

where "parameter\_name1", "parameter\_name2" and “parameter\_nameN” are the names of the parameters expected and imported in the called page.

**In the example below create Page “A” for the selection of parameters, which will then be passed to Page “B”**, using the _extRedirectToDsh_ function, entered in the code of a JavaScript object.

Step 1: Page with a Redirect ExtRedirectToDsh

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/98.png)

_In the Page called “A” a Text Field object named Year, a Text Field object named User, a multiselection type Styled Selector object (e.g. Checkbox) associated with the MONTH level, an Execute button and finally a JavaScript type object with the code shown in the figure are entered. In the code indicate that the redirection function is active upon clicking execute button._

Step 2: Page with a Redirect ExtRedirectToDsh

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/99 (3).png>)

_In the Page called “B”, with id '684350310331296' ("metadataInfo" property), a Crosstab associated with a report with the Year and Month levels is entered and with the following filters: MONTH@ID IN ('?\_month?') and YEAR@ID = '?\_year?'._

_By selecting and valuing the parameters Year, User and MONTH in Page A, the system updates the JavaScript object containing the parameters to be sent._

_By selecting the Execute button, the system will redirect to Page '684350310331296', passing all the parameters correctly._

**extOpenDshDialog, extOpenDshModalDialog and extOpenDshModalDialogParam**

The functions _**extOpenDshDialog**_ and _**extOpenDshModalDialog**_ open a window containing a particular Page.

The function _**extOpenDshDialog**_ opens a NON MODAL type window; access to the other windows is therefore permitted.

For the function _**extOpenDshModalDialog,**_ the opening of the window is of the MODAL type: i.e., access is blocked to the other windows until the modal one is not closed.

The function _**extOpenDshModalDialogParam**_ has the same behavior as the previous one, with the possibility of sending a list of the parameters to the Page.

The parameters of the functions are as follows:

* **dshID**: Id of the Page (mandatory)
* **title**: Title of the window (by default no title)
* **wiDSh**: wiDSh of the window in pixels or percentage (default 800)
* **height**: height of the window in pixels or percentage (default 600)
* **resizable**: flag to resize, maximize and iconize the window (default true)
* **top**: position from the top margin of the dialog (default center)
* **left**: position from the left margin of the dialog (default center)
* **idDialog**: ID of the window (random value by default)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100 (1).png>)

For the function _**extOpenDshModalDialogParam**_ the parameters to be sent to the Page are defined in the following format:

_\[{"name": "parameter\_name1", "value": ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_name2", "value ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_nameN", "Value ?parameterN?}]._

**Example of a Page with an extOpenDshDialog type pop-up**

Step 1: Page with pop-up type extOpenDshDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/101 (1).png>)

_Enter the text type object in the Page. Enter the Javascript code from the test property main section._

_The following code is entered:_

_\<script>_

_extOpenDshDialog('479348149187281', 'PAGE', '50%', '50%', false, 0, 0, 'idWinMod')_

_\<script>_

_In detail:_

* _'479348149187281'-> Page ID_
* _'PAGE'-> Window title_
* _‘50%’-> WiDSh of the pop-up_
* _‘50%’->Height of the pop-up_
* _‘False’-> redimensioning of the pop-up_
* _0-> position from the upper margin of the dialog_
* _0 -> position from the left margin of the dialog_
* _idWinMod-> Id of the dialog_

Step 2: Page with Pop-up Type extOpenDshDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/102 (1).png>)

_Access DAC. When first accessed, a window is shown containing a page defined in the link, which will be opened in modal mode. The window is non-modal; this allows navigation to the page below, even if the popup is closed._

**Example of a Page with an extOpenDshModalDialog tType Pop-up**

Step 1: Creating Page

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/103 (4).png>)

_Enter the text type object in the Page. Enter the Javascript code from the test property main section._

_The following code is entered:_

_\<script>_

_extOpenDshModalDialog('479348149187281', 'PAGE', '50%', '50%', false, 0, 0, 'idWinMod')_

_\<script>_

_In detail:_

* _'479348149187281'-> Page ID_
* _'PAGE'-> Window title_
* _‘50%’-> WiDSh of the pop-up_
* _‘50%’->Height of the pop-up_
* _‘False’-> redimensioning_ of _the pop-up_
* _0-> position from the upper margin of the dialog_
* _0 -> position from the left margin of the dialog_
* _idWinMod-> Id of the dialog_

Step 2: Visualization on DAC

&#x20;_Access DAC. When first accessed, a window is shown containing a page defined in the Page page, which will be opened in modal mode And browsing the underlying page will be locked until the window is closed by the user._

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/104.png)

**Report Management Functions**

In _the Report_ folder, functions are grouped that can be applied to a report as listed below:

* **extExportToExcel(id)**

Run the Excel export of a specific report (_**id**_:_object_-id of the crosstab containing the report to be exported)

* **extShowCSVExportSettings(**_**id**_**)**

Run the PDF export of a specific report (_**id**object_-id of the crosstab containing the report to be exported)

Open a specific report (_**id**_ _object-id_ of the crosstab containing the report to be launched) displaying it in the report section

* **extReinitPageBy(id)**

Restores the value of the page bys of a report. (_**id**_ _object-id_ ID of the crosstab object).

**Other Functions Available**

In the _Other_ folder some functions are listed which do not pertain to the management of reports or Pages, but are useful for the development of a Page.

* **extStartLoading()**

It shows a transparent image in front of the Page, stopping the changes in the underlying page. Useful during asynchronous operations.

* **extStopLoading()**

Remove the transparent image created through the _extStartLoading() function._

* **extShowWait()**

A please wait operation in progress image is shown.

* **extHideWaits()**

Remove the image shown by the _extShowWait() function._

* **extCloseDialog(idDialog)**

Closes a dialog previously opened, allows the id of the dialog to be closed as single mandatory parameter.

* &#x20;**extCloseCurrentDialog()**

The current window closes.

* extDialog and **extConfirmDialog**

To open a pop-up containing a text message and an icon for the type of message.

In the second function, separate actions can be associated both for confirmation and cancellation. Both pop-ups are modal.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/105.png)

* **extOpenDialog, extOpenModalDialog and extOpenModalDialogParam**

To open a web page, by simply indicating the address; also in this case the functions support one of the two types of opening, modal and non-modal. In addition a function allows the passing of parameters.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/106.jpeg)

* **extGetDialogWindowOpener:**

This is applied to a window open in Drill-Through and returns the **reference to the calling window** (Page or report). Once the _calling_ reference is obtained, from the _calling window_ the system functions may be performed on the _calling_ window.

**Example**

_You want to update a report on a Page, starting from a window open in drill-through. In the calling window, enter an Execute button and in the javascript-code-after property of the object, enter the following code:_

_//report code to be updated, in the calling Page_

_var_ _**reportId:**_ _= '394336474062156';_

_//reference to the calling window_

_var_ _fwin =_ _**extGetDialogWindowOpener();**_

_//check the existence of the_ _**fwin**_ _calling window and the report updating function_

_**If**_ _(fwin&& fwin!=null && fwin.extRefreshReport)_

_{_

_//updates the report in the calling window_

_fwin.extRefreshReport(**reportId:**);_

_}_

* **extShowNotification(Notification**_**:, icon, notificationMessage, autoClose, cssClassName**_**)**

Function which displays a notification message

0 (blank, default); 1 (info); 2 (notification); 2 (Error)

* _**notificationMessage**_**:** detail message of the notification (default is blank)
* _**autoClose**_**:** automatic closure of the notification window (default: true)
* _**cssClassName**_**:**&#x41;ssociated CSS Class (default: none)
* **extDialog**

The **extDialog** function opens a pop-up with a simple text message.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/107 (4).png>)

This type of window is modal: to access the calling page you must first close the pop-up.

It **is possible** to graphically customize the window, **by changing the default of the following parameters:**

* **message**: text message or html displayed in the pop-up (mandatory);
* **title**: title of the pop-up;
* **icon**: icon for the type of message:
  * 0: No icon _(default)_,
  * 1: Info
  * 2: Warning
  * 3: Error
  * 4: Question

In case of entering an incorrect value the default is set automatically;

* **wiDSh**: wiDSh in pixels or percentage _(default 300)_
* **height**: height in pixels or percentage _(default null)_
* **idDialog**: ID of the pop-up _(default casual value)_

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/108.png)

Below are some examples for each type of message. For each window the related creation code is shown.

Step 2: Page configuration with pop-up extDialog

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/115.png)

_Open the preview. The underlying page is obscured and browsing remains blocked until the user presses the pop-up confirmation button._

**extConfirmDialog**

The "extConfirmDialog" **function** opens a window with a confirmation message (non-modal).

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/116 (4).png>)

This function lets you define an action after clicking the confirmation or cancellation button.

It **is possible** to graphically customize the window, **by changing the default of the following parameters:**

* **message**: text message or html shown in the window (mandatory);
* **title**: title of the pop-up (mandatory);
* **onConfirm**: action to be performed when clicking on the confirmation button (mandatory)
* **onCancel**: action to be performed when clicking on the cancellation button
* **icon**: icon for the type of message:
  * 0: No icon,
  * Info _(default)_
  * 2: Warning
  * 3: Error
  * 4: Question

In case an incorrect value is entered, the default is set automatically;

* **labelYes**: label of the confirmation button _(default YES)_
* **labelNo**: label of the cancellation button _(default NO)_
* **wiDSh**: wiDSh of the dialog in pixels or percentage _(default 300)_
* **height**: height of the dialog in pixels or percentage _(default null)_
* **idDialog**: id of the dialog _(default casual value)_

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/117 (1).png>)

Below are some examples of a customized window, with its code.

**Default window**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/118 (4).png>)

_\<script>extConfirmDialog('Text Message',Info,'alert(“Message on Yes button”)')\</script>_

**Window with information message and confirm and cancel buttons**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/119.png)

_\<script>_

_extConfirmDialog('Text Message',Info, 'alert(“Message on YES button”)', 'alert(“Message on NO button”)', '1', 'OK','CANCEL','300',110,'MyDialog' )_

_\<script>_

**Window with information message and confirm and cancel buttons**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/120.png)

_\<script>_

_extConfirmDialog('Text Message',Warning,'alert(1)','alert("2")','2','OK','CANCEL','300',110,'MyDialog' )_

_\</_**\<script>**

**Window with error message and confirm and cancel buttons.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/121 (3).png>)

_\<script>_

_extConfirmDialog('Text Message',Error,'alert(1)','alert("2")','3','OK','CANCEL','300',110,'MyDialog' )_

_\<script>_

**Window with question type message with confirm and cancel buttons**

_\<script>_

_extConfirmDialog('Text Message',Question,'alert(1)','alert("2")','4','OK','CANCEL','300',110,'MyDialog' )_

_\<script>_

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/122.png)

Step 1: Page with pop-up type ExtConfirmDialog

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/123.png)

_In this example, you want to open a warning pop-up when opening a Page. The pop-up will be of the modal type, with confirm or cancel keys. For the creation, a text object is entered inside the Page. In the text property enter the Javascript function:_

_\<script>_

_extConfirmDialog ('You are about to save this item. It cannot be restored at a later time continue?', 'Warning','alert("Data have been saved")','alert("Reselect date")','2','OK','CANCEL','300',null,'MyDialog' )_

_\<script>_

_In detail:_

* _extConfirmDialog Function for the pop-up_
* _‘You are about to save this item…’ Text of the message_
* _'Warning' Title of the pop-up_
* _'alert("Data have been saved")' Action associated with the confirm key_
* _'alert("Reselect date")' Action associated with the cancel key_
* _2 Warning icon type_
* &#x20;_‘OK’ Confirm key_
* _‘CANCEL’- Cancel key_
* _300,null- WiDSh and height of the pop-up_
* _'MyDialog'->Id of the Pop-up._

Step 2: Page with pop-up type ExtConfirmDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/124 (3).png>)

_Access DAC. The underlying page is obscured and browsing remains locked as long as the user does not press one of the two buttons._

_If you select the confirm button the alert associated with it is displayed. The same thing for the cancel key._

**extOpenDialog, extOpenModalDialog and extOpenModalDialogParam**

The **extOpenDialog** type function opens a NON MODAL window, containing a page of a specific URL.

The **extOpenModalDialog** type function also opens a window with the content of a URL, though the opening is of the MODAL type. Thus browsing the underlying page will be locked until the window is closed by the user.

The **extOpenModalDialogParam** function has the same behavior as the previous function (therefore MODAL), but includes the possibility of sending a list of parameters.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/125 (3).png>)

The parameters of the three functions are:

* **src**: URL (mandatory)
* **title**: Title of the window (by default no title)
* **wiDSh**: wiDSh of the window in pixels or percentage (default 800)
* **height**: height of the window in pixels or percentage (default 600)
* **resizable**: flag to resize, maximize and iconize the window (default true)
* **top**: position from the top margin of the dialog (default center)
* **left**: position from the left margin of the dialog (default center)
* **idDialog**: ID of the window (random value by default)

For the function **extOpenModalDialogParam** the parameters to be sent to the URL are defined in the following format:

_\[{"name": "parameter\_name1", "value": ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_name2", "value ?parameter1?}, { "name": "parameter\_nameN", "Value ?parameterN?}]._

**Example of a Page with an extOpenDialog Type Pop-up**

Step 1: Page with Pop-up Type extOpenDialog

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/126.png)

_Enter the text type object in the Page. Enter the Javascript code from the test property main section._

_The following code is entered:_

_\<script>_

_extOpenDialog('http://www.decisyon.com','Decisyon','800','600','true','center','center','MyDialog')_

_\<script>_

_In detail:_

* _‘‘http://www.decisyon.com’ -> Real link to the Web page._
* _'Decisyon'-> Title of the pop.up._
* _800,600-> WiDSh and height of the pop-up._
* _' true '-> Automatic resize popup._
* _' center ', ' center '-> position compared to the top and left margin._
* _'MyDialog'->Id of the Pop-up._

Step 2: Page with pop-up type extOpenDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/127 (1).png>)

_Access DAC. When accessing for the first time, the pop-up is shown which displays the web page specified in the code. The window is non-modal; this lets you browse the underlying page, even if the pop-up is not closed._

**Example of a Page with an extOpenModalDialog type pop-up**

Step 1: Page with pop-up type extOpenModalDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/128 (3).png>)

_Enter the text type object in the Page. Enter the Javascript code from the test property main section._

_The following code is entered:_

_\<script>_

_extOpenModalDialog('http://www.decisyon.com','Decisyon','800','600','true','center','center','MyDialog')_

_\<script>_

_In detail:_

* _‘_[_‘_](http://www.decisyon.com/)[_http://www.decisyon.com_](http://www.decisyon.com/)_’ -> Real link to the Web page._
* _'Decisyon'-> Title of the pop.up._
* _800,600-> WiDSh and height of the pop-up._
* _' true '-> Automatic resize popup._
* _' center ', ' center '-> position compared to the top and left margin._
* _'MyDialog'->Id of the Pop-up._

Step 2: Page with pop-up type extOpenModalDialog

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/129 (2).png>)

_Access DAC. When first accessed, a window is shown containing a page defined in the link, which will be opened in modal mode. In this case browsing the underlying page will be locked until the window is closed by the user._

#### Notification Designer

The notification service is a complete contact management system which lets companies optimally manage their communication with user groups or single users. A management system allows users to create, review and send notification messages, without requiring users to always be connected to the application.

The type of notification is:

* Mai&#x6C;**,** where the notification is sent by e-mail;

From the **Application>> Notification Designer** menu, open the window that manages the notification service.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/130.png)

In the Mail notification we define the send mode, the recipients and the message with the title.

**Notification Transmission**

Notifications can be sent instantly, by clicking the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/131.png) button.

During execution, the system displays the dialog window _Execution log_ which displays the different steps, detailing the instructions which are carried out.

The steps are highlighted in red if there are errors such as missing privileges, reports not found, etc. The figure shows an example where a user does not have the license to receive notifications.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/132 (2).png>)

Notifications can be also sent through:

* a schedule defined with the _Scheduler_ modul&#x65;_._
* via a command in a Page . In this case, the recipients can be set dynamically: we can select recipients on the Page, in addition to those set in the notification itself.
* SQL commands, when a JOB is created .

**Notification Recipients**

You can select **Notification recipients** in the **Groups** section; you can choose them by groups or individually. To send the notification, DAC takes the information from user configuration, shown in the figure, which indicates the data used for each type of notification.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/133 (1).png>)

### **Notification Message**

Notification messages are composed of a title and the actual message. In the message it is possible to enter custom parameters, such as the username:

selecting the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/134.png) button will enter the keyword %SUBJECT%; this will be replaced by the corresponding recipient username, when the notification is sent.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/135 (2).png>)

For e-mail notifications, there are functions for the formatting of reports in text \[form].

**E-mail Notifications**

With e-mail notifications, you can send reports and/or Pages in different formats, including DAC format.

The message can contain information about one or more reports formatted through Pattern.

For sending notification e-mails, the **mail server** must be defined in the _Server Designer_ module (see _Server connections_ section, parag. _SMTP server_) and then associated in the system properties _**associated–SMTP-server**_ ( _Tools properties_, _E-mail_ section, _System E-mails_ group)_._

To create this type of notification, select the **Create Mail notification** item from the pop-up menu on the _Root._

The sender of the email server may be defined, differently from the system-wide one (through the Server Designer) in the properties (_Main_ group):

* _**the default email-notification-sender**_ is identified, in parentheses, as the sender defined in the _email-sender_ property in the _Server designer_; this may be edited, entering a different email address to be used as the sender.
* _**the default email-sender-name**_ indicates, in parentheses, the name to be associated with the sender defined in the _email-sender-name_ property in the _Server designer_; this may be edited, entering a different name to be used as the sender.

You can associate one or more user groups to an e-mail notification, which must be CC'ed in the e-mail, using the property:

* _**CC**_ opens a window for selecting DAC groups and/or users to be added to the mailing list as CC. These users must also have a _Notification_ license. Users associated with multiple groups will receive only one copy of the email.

**Report and Page Attachments**

You can choose the reports and Pages to attach to the e-mail using the appropriate buttons, as shown in the figure (_**Attachments**_ panel): the reports/Pages attached are placed in the bottom table. A menu is enabled for each one that allows you to select an export format.

The formats available for the **report** are:

* _PDF_ or _Excel_
* text (_TEXT_) or _CSV_
* or by directly accessing the report in DAC (WEB).

While a **Page** can be sent in the formats:

* PDF or Excel (configured beforehand)
* by directly accessing the Page in DAC (WEB).

the prior configuration of a Page must be completed in the Page Designer module

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/136 (1).png>)

**WEB Format**

The **WEB** format sends you a link that will allow you to directly access the report or the Page, without having to be authenticated.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/137 (2).png>)

To use this type of format, you must set the address of DAC for the connection in the system properties:

* _**decisyonWebURL**_ (_Tools properties_, _Web section,_ _Connection_ group) enter the DAC link.

**Report Pattern (formatting report in the message)**

The e-mail notification message can contain information from one or more reports, which are formatted according to patterns specified by the user instead of being sent in the usual tabular form.

For example, you can list products sold to a certain customer, in a text form such as: _Product X’ was sold to 'Client Y’ with sales for ‘sales value', where the_ product, the client and the sales value are given a value in the report.

The pattern is set in the _**pattern{n}**_ property (_Report Pattern_ group), enabled from the _**patterns-number**_ property (by default set to 0), which indicates the number of patterns you intend to define.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/138 (2).png>)

You can open a window from the _**pattern{n}**_ property, shown in the figure above, where you can select the report with the information to be formatted.

After choosing the report, _Column_ lists the references to the columns of the report itself: with the + **+**&#x62;utton (on the right) we input the references in the text area below, under _Pattern_, together with the desired textual form (an example is given by default).

The section to be used for the text (in HTML format) is enclosed between quotation marks and is linked to the report columns with the + command. **+**.

The preview button (shown in the picture) displays the text formatted according to the pattern input in the text area.

_Excel-like functions_ are also supported, selected with the button shown in the figure. The functions to format metric values are particularly useful.

After defining one or more patterns, you can input them in the message title or body, simply by indicating the reference to the chosen pattern: this enables a list for selecting the pattern, which you can input in the message by clicking the + Button.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/139 (2).png>)

An example of the application of the _Report Pattern_ method is shown below, where a text string is defined for the list of sales of each product and detail for the customer groups the product was sold to.

Example : Report Pattern

Step 1: Report Pattern

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/140 (1).png>)

_We define an e-mail notification. In patterns-number we set the value 2: we enable the corresponding pattern{1} and pattern{2} properties._

_You define the e-mail message for the list of products sold with reference to the pattern{1}, and the detail list with reference to the pattern {2}._

Step 2: Report Pattern

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/141 (1).png>)

_We define the report for the list of products sold: the report has the Product level and the metric Sales Val._

_In the pattern{1}, the window opens for defining the first pattern: the text shown in the figure is inserted._

_You can see the text form in the preview, where references to the corresponding report columns are shown._

Step 3: Report Pattern

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/142 (1).png>)

_We define the report for the detail list (product sales and corresponding customer groups): the report will contain the Product and Customer Group, with the metric Sales Val._

_The window opens in pattern{2} for defining the second pattern, where we insert the text shown in the figure._

_You can see the text form in the preview, where references to the corresponding report columns are shown_**.**

Step 4: Report Pattern

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/143 (1).png>)

_In the picture we see the e-mail message received by the user associated with the notification. The two parts of the message, corresponding to the patterns defined in the notification, are pointed out._

### Resource Catalog

Resources that refer to files, images and CSS, that can be used by other DAC modules, can be “loaded” into the application. In addition to individual files, the system can load entire folders and subfolders.

With the **Resource catalogue** module (_**Application**_ menu item), a real catalog of the resources is created, which may be used as:

* Images loaded into a Page
* Images loaded on TAG @IMG for levels and metrics
* JavaScript or CSS associated with Page pages
* Logos for PDF exports

Use the **New** button to open a window with access to the local folders. This is where you can select the file and generate a resource.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/144 (1).png>)

Once the resource is selected, a window opens, where confirmation to perform the loading is requested. Once the operation is confirmed, a progress bar is displayed.

Once loading has finished, the resource is added to the document repository:

* For the resource to be generated, you have to configure this repository beforehand.

You cannot rename loaded resources since the name of the resource must coincide with the name of the loaded file.

Mass deletion of several resources is allowed by selecting them and choosing delete (right button of the mouse). Once the resource is selected, a window opens, where confirmation to perform the deletion is requested. Once the operation is confirmed, a progress bar will be displayed.

In case a mass resource deletion is interrupted, the system deletes up to the current resource and interrupts the flow. Likewise, to interrupt a mass import, the system loads up to the current resource and interrupts the flow.

Once the file is uploaded, you can enter the resource information in detail:

* The _Browse_ button (_Update_ pane) opens the loading page of the resources to make the updates.
* In the _Resource details_ pane, all the information on the resource is detailed: the file name, its creation date, the user who created it, the date of the last change, the type and measurements of the file.
* The _Preview_ pane shows a preview of the file if possible
* The _Download_ button (_Download file_ pane), saves the resource in the local folder.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/145.png)

**Loading Talend Jobs**

For the Talend Job to be correctly recognized within DAC, it must be generated through the export of a **.zip** file, containing folders and files, as described below:

* **lib**
  * _\[JOB Name]_
    * _\[PROJECT Name]_
      * ….
* **jobInfo.properties**

If the file of the Talend Job has this structure when it is loaded as a resource in the catalog, it is recognized as a **Job Talend** type resource, as shown in the figure below.

In the summary information, the type and the name of the Job's main class are specifie&#x64;**.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/146 (1).png>)

The Talend Job loaded using this method will be available to be associated with:

* A Talend Integration schedule

An **Execute button**, of a TALEND\_INTEGRATION type

**Note:** _The_ _Talend version supported is 5.5.1._

### Schedules Designer

A schedule consists of preparing, managing and monitoring a plan for performing the activities foreseen on a time calendar (daily, weekly, monthly). A schedule of this type is created through the **Schedules Designer** module, which is opened from the _Application_ menu item.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/147 (1).png>)

To create a schedule, set:

* _**Start scheduling**_ _–_
  * _**Date**_ and _**Time zone**_ _**-**_ The start date and time zone the times refer to
* _**Schedule Interval**_ - Scheduling time with regular time intervals, for which you set:
* _**Start time**_, _**Stop time**_ and _**Interval**_.

_**Note:**_ _In the stop scheduling time, the minutes are set to 59, therefore, if 16 is specified as_ _**Stop**_ _**time**, the end will be at 16:59._

* _**Schedule Time**_ - Scheduling time defined with single times. It is an alternative to the scheduling interval. Set the time (_**Hours**_) and (_**Minutes**_) for each schedule to start.
* _**Month Day**_ - Day of the month when the schedule starts. To set more single days, separate with a comma. The intervals are defined with start and stop day separated by “-“.
* _**Week day**_ - Days of the week when the schedule starts.

#### Scheduler (Task Schedule)

Use the **Scheduler** module to plan the updating and executing of certain logical objects based on a schedule, which was previously defined with the Schedules Designer module.

Open _Scheduler_ from the _Application_ menu item.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/148 (1).png>)

The planning of a task, or updating rule, takes place by selecting the objects to be performed and by associating a schedule in the _**schedule**_ property: at the top right the date and time of the next execution is indicated.

The _**execution of the refresh rule**_ will be launched by DAC according to the definitions in the time schedule (e.g. every morning at 11:36).

The refresh rules may be also be performed through SQL commands, through the creation of a JOB, with the _**activateRefresh**_ property which enables (as default) or disables the planned execution of the refresh activity. Objects affected by a Refresh Rule are described in the image below.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/149 (1).png>)

A Refresh Rule can be defined for the following objects:

* Absolute cache reports
* Alarms
* Notifications
* Dsearch Server update
* DLR execution
* Job Talend execution

The objects selected are indicated automatically in the middle pane with the object name, date and time of the last execution (_**Execution date**_), (_**Execution time**_) and (_**Average time**_), the number of executions performed (_**En**_), the number of executions completed with errors (_**Er**_) and the **total** for each field in the bottom row. The objects are sorted inside the list by using drag & drop.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/150 (1).png>)

If the execution ends successfully, a green check is displayed, otherwise a red X is displayed.

In case of error the schedule does not block: select the row of the object performed with error to view the date and the details of the error in the bottom section.

**Talend Integration Scheduling**

The Talend Integration type allows you to start a Talend Job through scheduling.

The Job created on Talend should be loaded as a resource in the Resource Catalog, which will recognize it as a Talend Job type resource.

If the associated resource contains more jobs, the one associated with the Main Class, recognized by DAC (contained in the bat file), will be executed. If the associated resource contains a job with multiple child jobs, the parent job will be performed first and, in sequence, the child jobs.

Selecting the **TALEND\_INTEGRATION** key will open a pop-up for the selection of the job to execute. The window lists all Talend Job type resources loaded in the Resource Catalog.

#### Validating DAC objects

Validation is an automatic process which makes it possible to verify that the metadata underlying the application loaded and used for report definition are correct, and to ensure that tables and links exist.

After accessing the **Application>>Utilities>>Validate** menu, it is possible to:

* validate all application objects (**Validate All…**)
* validate individual objects categories (**Validate cubes, Validate dimensions, Validate metrics, Validate** filters)
* verify the SQL syntax underlying the application reports (Test **model reports**)
* execute the report using the cache or not (**Execute reports (cache)** or **Execute reports (full**_)_

During the execution of the validation processes, the system shows a window which lists the objects being validated (with a green check for those successfully validated and a red cross for the invalid ones)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/151.png)

If an error occurs, the reason for the failures is registered and displayed by the _**log**_ folder, while the validation process continues on the remaining objects. In addition, you can interrupt the execution of the validation (_**Abort**_ button) and export the log of the validations up to that point (_**Export**_ button).

A progress bar shows the process execution in real time.

### Task

DAC offers a solution to manage activities and to assign tasks to users.

You can manage tasks in DAC through reports or Page components enabled for this purpose. You can assign tasks:

* on the report cells
* on some Page components (Graph, Indicator, Table)

Tasks can be notified to recipients through e-mails which give direct access to the task. Therefore, in order to access the task, the mail server and DAC server must be configured (see next paragraph).

**Configuring Task Notifications for E-mail**

The mail server for sending notification e-mails must be defined in the _Server Designer_ module and then associated in the system properties _**associated–SMTP-server**_ (_Tools preference_, _E-mail_ sectio&#x6E;_, System Emails_ group)_._

The e-mails contain a link for directly accessing the assigned Tasks; the reference to DAC must therefore be defined in the system properties:

_**decisyonWebURL**_ (_Tools properties_, _Web section,_ _Connection group_) enter the DAC link.

**Enabling Task on the Report**

You will need to set the properties in the _Body_ section for reports that have to be used in the task assignment process:

_**activateCellsTask**_ allows you to enable the insertion of the new task on the report cells

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/152 (1).png>)

_**viewCellinfoTask**_ to display, on the metric cells, information about the percentage deviation between the metric and set target

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/153.png)

**Enabling Tasks on Page Components**

The Page components used during the task assignment process are:

* Tables
* Crosstabs
* Graphs
* Indicators

You can enable components for the assignment of tasks in the following way:

* enable the component title with the _**show-Title**_ property of the **Title** group
* enable the _**activate-Task**_ property, always in the **Title** group.

Example: Displaying Tasks on a Component - GRAPH

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (132).png>)

_From Page Designer, we enter the graph-type component and in the TITLE section we enable the property activate-task. The graph in DAC will display the task button_ ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/155 (1).png>) _next to the title. Clicking the button opens the window for inserting the new task._
