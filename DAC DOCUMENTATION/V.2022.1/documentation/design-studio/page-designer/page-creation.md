# Page Creation



To create a new Page press the **New** button. From the **Insert page name** property, assign the name to the page you are creating, while in the **Select** **Template Style** section the system displays a gallery of templates that may be used as a starting structure for the creation of a new page.

Selecting the **Empty** template lets you create a page without the row and column structure already predefined in the page.

_Selecting template “3 box 1 Row” will have the structure shown in the figure, to which additional row containers and column containers can be added._

### Default Title for a Page

When you create a new page, the Page Design starts a wizard that allows you to set the name for the page (see image below). The title defined in the Page Design Catalog will be associated by default with the page container. This way, you can easily and quickly create new pages and assign the name.

In the group **Title** of the **Container** folder, the property **show-title** is enabled by default and the property **title-text** is set as **%PAGE\_TITLE%.**

When you access **DAC**, the title of the page will be the same as the name defined in the Page Design catalog.
