To publish a Page, first set the _**display privileges**_.

By default the page is associated with the _**Everyone**_ group. This Group is created by the system, includes all users on the system, and includes the permissions to access the application and display all objects of the application.

In the next step, the pages you want to publish in DAC are moved to the **Published** folder.

The **Published** folder catalogs the Pages that are made available to the end users, respecting the privileges assigned. The catalog defined in this way is published on DAC in the **Application section.**

The first Page in the list will be the Page, visible to the connected user, run automatically when accessing DAC.

The Catalog can be customized by applying one of the **themes and styles available for the application**.

**Page Preview**

When designing a Page, it is possible to get a preview by accessing the **View Page** button.

The system opens the browser and displays the preview of the page selected in the catalog.

To open the preview DAC starts the local DAC, if not yet started and, automatically manages the authentication of the user without having to insert the credentials.

The system will show the preview page even if it's not published and if it's not associated with a Group.
