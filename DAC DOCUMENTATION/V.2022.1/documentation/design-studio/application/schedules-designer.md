# Schedules Designer

A schedule consists of preparing, managing and monitoring a plan for performing the activities foreseen on a time calendar (daily, weekly, monthly). A schedule of this type is created through the **Schedules Designer** module, which is opened from the _Application_ menu item.

To create a schedule, set:

* _**Start scheduling**_ _–_
  * _**Date**_ and _**Time zone**_ _**-**_ The start date and time zone the times refer to
* _**Schedule Interval**_ - Scheduling time with regular time intervals, for which you set:
* _**Start time**_, _**Stop time**_ and _**Interval**_.

_**Note:**_ _In the stop scheduling time, the minutes are set to 59, therefore, if 16 is specified as_ _**Stop**_ _**time**, the end will be at 16:59._

* _**Schedule Time**_ - Scheduling time defined with single times. It is an alternative to the scheduling interval. Set the time (_**Hours**_) and (_**Minutes**_) for each schedule to start.
* _**Month Day**_ - Day of the month when the schedule starts. To set more single days, separate with a comma. The intervals are defined with start and stop day separated by “-“.
* _**Week day**_ - Days of the week when the schedule starts.
