# Web Overview

DAC is the user interface of DAC’s Design Studio. The DAC environment is a web-based analysis where apps created in DAC Design Studio are published. To access the application need to enter the credentials provided by the administrator.

The analyses are carried out on reports and pages, that are collected in applications. The main DAC function is to facilitate collaborative analysis of the data, reports and KPIs available.

You access the applications from the DAC Home page.

After logging in, if enabled by the administrator, you have to accept the terms of use in order to access the DAC applications. Vedi Terms of Use

In the upper right you can access the [Report Catalog](https://documentation.decisyon.com/documentation/report/report-1/report-catalog) which contains all reports created in the Application.

When you select a page to display the content, on the left is the icon to open the **Page Catalog** that contains the list of published pages in the application.

For each page there is a side menu that is enabled by selecting the icon with the contextual menu. Remember that in order to [change the page properties](../../page-designer/create-and-publish-pages/page-management-to-web.md) the logged-in user must have an administration role.
