In DAC you can quickly navigate the contents that you visited (Report, Page, , Document and Task) with the feature **Recent Contents**.

You can access **Recent Contents** by selecting the button on the toolbar. You can view a list of the most recent content you have visited, and go back and forth among objects you last visited without having to search in your applications.
