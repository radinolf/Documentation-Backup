{% hint style="danger" %}

{% endhint %}

DAC users can display notifications that were sent to them using the dedicated section called Incoming mail. You can access the section through the button at the top.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (31).png>)

The button also shows the number of notifications still unread.

**Note:** If the number is higher than 99, it is displayed as 99+.

If the user is logged in to DAC, notifications will arrive in real time. Otherwise, the notifications can be viewed when you log in.

All communications sent directly to the user arrive in the user's Incoming mail, for example:

* The creation of new contents, which by default are followed in your Incoming mail.
* Private messages among users.
* Notes.
* Invitations to participate in spaces.
* Request for membership in spaces.

When a new message is created to users who were previously contacted, the history of conversations with these users will appear at the end. If a new user is added to the list, the list will display the history of conversations.

Notifications listSelected notification contentSearch notificationsNotification management

The notifications are **listed** on the left of the Incoming mail window, while the **content** of the selected notification are shown on the right.

Each notification in the list is accompanied by the button that corresponds to its notification type, so you can distinguish in an instant the type of content that you are receiving the notification for -- a  document, task etc.

By selecting a notification, you can add comments on the content that the notification pertains to. . For example, by adding a comment to a notification relating to a document, the new comment will be displayed in the section of the document itself.

**Comment on** the notification

When notifications are commented on or updated by other users, the system will not create a new notification, but will always mark that notification as "unread".

**Note:**    Deleting a notification does not delete the conversation attached to it. The user who had deleted the notification will see the entire previous conversation again.

A search field is available at the top along with a filter by object type to which the notification is associated.

Selecting a notification enables the buttons in the upper left and indicated in the figure below:
