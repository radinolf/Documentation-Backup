# Debug

The _**debug-mode**_ property (_Main_ group) allows users to display on request, in DAC, the code SQL generated for the report and the number of executions.

If the debug has been activated, we display in DAC the Debug Info property in the contextual menu of the report.

When we select this item, a window will open with information on the report, such as:

* report name and ID
* use of cache with date of creation
* execution times
* rows found in datamart

The figure shows an example debug window.
