# Introduction - Migration Notes

The purpose of this document is to show the changes and impact in migrating Decisyon App Composer projects. During the migration phase, the system administrator must consider the information reported in this document, in order to correctly perform the version passage. In the version passages, which mean a minor release change (e.g.: from Name1 to Name2), we strongly advise carrying out a check of the correct operation of the migrated applications in a test environment, prior to their actual passage to production.
