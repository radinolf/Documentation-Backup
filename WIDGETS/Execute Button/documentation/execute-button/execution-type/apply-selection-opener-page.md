# APPLY SELECTION OPENER PAGE

## Overview

This operation applies the selection on a page opened in a pop-up to the source page. As a result, a target page can be opened in a drill through starting from a source page. When the execute button is clicked, the target page selections are applied to the main page. Thus, the target page will serve as the selector, while the source page will get the effects of the selection.
