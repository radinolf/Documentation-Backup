# Color-Palette

In the **Chart** widget, the **color-palette** property allow app developers to customize the colors used in the chart. This can help to create a more visually appealing and informative charts that are easier to read and understand.

The Chart widget has a default color palette that is used for the different data series within the chart.

The colors of the palette used in the chart are determined by the report items (levels or metrics) positioned in the columns. According to the order in which the elements were added to the report, the color from the palette is applied (for example, the first metric added to the report will use the first color from the palette, the second column will use the second color of the palette and so on).

Below there are two different examples:

In the first picture, a level (YEAR) has been added to the column and the Metric (UNIT\_SOLD) to the page by of the report. As shown, each year is given a color from the palette in the order of left to right.

You can also customize these colors to better match your need or to differentiate between different data series within the chart.

Once you have selected a color scheme or created your own, you can apply it to your chart by assigning the colors to the different data series.
