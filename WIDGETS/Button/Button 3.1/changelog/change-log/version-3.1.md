# Version 3.1

## 🔧Fixed <a href="#toc68682153" id="toc68682153"></a>

* DC-1569 – **Primary color not applied correctly**

Fixed issue where the Button widget occasionally failed to inherit the primary color for both background and text, incorrectly applying styles from the global CSS instead.

* DC-1562 – **Secondary color not applied in Fab and Mini Fab types**

Fixed issue where **Fab** and **Mini Fab** button types did not apply the correct foreground (text) color based on theme inheritance, causing inconsistent contrast and readability.
